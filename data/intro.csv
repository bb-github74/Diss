First  it is shown that the self-organization of financial markets is a crucial factor in the understanding of their dynamics. In fact, using an agent-based approach, it is argued that financial markets’ stylized facts appear only in the self-organized state. Secondly, the thesis points out the potential of so-called big data science for financial market modeling, investigating how web-driven data can yield a picture of market activities:  it has been found that web query volumes anticipate trade volumes. As a third achievement, the metrics developed here for country competitiveness and product complexity is groundbreaking in comparison to mainstream theories of economic growth and technological development. A key element in assessing the intangible variables determining the success of countries in the present globalized economy is represented by the diversification of the productive basket of countries. The comparison between the level of complexity of a country's productive system  and economic indicators such as the GDP per capita discloses its hidden growth potential."

This book presents a collection of papers on a series of exploratory studies on the rise and fall of downtowns (Downtown Dynamics), which the author’s group has been working on with the aim of constructing an artificial society that contributes to the planning and management of crowds by developing Agent-Based Social Simulation (ABSS). In particular, the book includes (1) an analysis of 20 years’ worth of survey data on visitors’ shopping-around behavior for Osu district in Nagoya city, as a representative Japanese downtown, (2) correlation analyses of spatial distributions between Visibility Graph Analysis (VGA) as a “visibility index” and crowding in middle scale urban spaces, (3) agent modeling of visitors’ shopping-around behavior and construction of the Downtown Dynamics Model as an artificial society, and (4) modeling of the vision-driven agent as a “crowd generator” and its applicability to spatial design and sign layout in urban spaces. The book also includes a novel research program derived from complexity system science that provides new approaches to Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), social simulation, regional sciences, geo-informatics, and urban planning studies for researchers and graduate students, as well as planning scientists and practitioners such as town managers and planners who are concerned with downtown revitalization. ."

Most standard economic models assume the existence of the representative agent, who is “perfectly rational” and applies the utility maximization principle when taking action. One reason for this is the desire to keep models mathematically tractable: no tools are available to economists for solving non-linear models of heterogeneous adaptive agents without explicit optimization. In contrast, multi-agent models, which originated from statistical physics considerations, allow us to go beyond the prototype theories of traditional economics involving the representative agent. This book is based on the Econophys-Kolkata VII Workshop, at which many such modelling efforts were presented. In the book, leading researchers in their fields report on their latest work, consider recent developments and review the contemporary literature."
alma9947050968404105,,Economics for a fairer society : going back to basics using agent-based models,"Gooding, Tim.",2019,,,,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,"This Palgrave Pivot presents experiments that reveal core dynamics of trade in a complex system. Monetary trade is stripped of all its complications and placed in agent-based models, a complexity research tool capable of reproducing emergent behaviour and evolution. Included are ground-breaking repeatable experiments exploring the impact of evolutionary prerequisites empirically present in markets. Isolating the core dynamics of trade results in very simple agent-based models. However, decades of complexity research demonstrate that even the simplest systems result in emergent behaviour that is extremely difficult to anticipate. Readers who are only familiar with the linear-system theories and models used to train almost all undergraduate economics students might be surprised to witness price detaching from supply and demand, and extreme poverty and wealth arising in trade systems populated by agents with equal ability and opportunity. Watch as empirical evolutionary prerequisites are introduced and price patterns characterising two different markets – asset markets and speculative markets – emerge irrespective of supply and demand. In addition to laying the groundwork of monetary trade in a complex system, more complicated models feature mortal reproductive agents. Including ‘living’ populations in economic models reveal how the complexity characteristics of our market economy are impacting impoverishment and starvation. This book invites anyone interested in economics to join the growing ranks of people who are fascinated by the insights offered by complexity research. ."

The field of artificial economics covers a broad range of methodologies relying on computer simulations in order to model and study the complexity of economic and social phenomena. The grounding principle of artificial economics is the analysis of aggregate properties of simulated systems populated by interacting adaptive agents that are equipped with heterogeneous individual behavioral rules. These macroscopic properties are neither foreseen nor intended by the artificial agents but generated collectively by them. They are emerging characteristics of such artificially simulated systems."

This <i>classical</i> footing of the study of development is different from the <i>neoclassical</i> perspective in two important respects: (a) it focuses on division of labor as the driving force of development, and (b) it emphasizes the role of the market (the ""invisible hand"") in exploiting productivity gains that are derived from division of labor.

alma9931602773404105,,Banking and asset bubbles : testing the theory of free banking using agent-based computer simulations and laboratory experiments,"McBride, William Howard Alford and Houser, Daniel",2010,,,,,,,[publisher not identified],Place of publication not identified,"Throughout much of the 18th and 19th centuries, many countries practiced free banking, i.e. competitive note issue without control by a central bank. Modern day proponents of free banking argue it is capable of limiting asset bubbles by making for a more stable relationship between the volume of base money present in an economy and corresponding levels of credit and aggregate spending. The main contribution of this dissertation is to provide a novel test of this claim by using the canonical laboratory double auction asset trading market (CLDAATM) initiated by Vernon Smith and others, which tends to generate asset price bubbles. Chapter 1 describes an agent-based model and simulation of CLDAATM using three types of trading strategies: value, momentum, and speculative. The results closely resemble the asset price bubbles generated in the laboratory. Chapter 2 augments the design of Chapter 1 by adding an agent-based model and simulation of banking, with the purpose of comparing both free and central banking to CLDAATM. The results indicate that both free and central banking reduce the tendency to bubble as compared to CLDAATM, and free banking is most effective in this regard. Chapter 3 describes a laboratory experiment design which augments CLDAATM using simulated trading and banking agents."

Behavior in seemingly different areas such as sociology, economics, and the life sciences can be described by closely related models. Systems made out of a large enough number of individual members can be said to exhibit a collective behavior, from which insight can be gathered in a way that real-life experiments cannot. Using examples from financial markets and modern warfare to the flocking of birds and the swarming of bacteria, the collected research in this volume demonstrates the common methodological approaches and tools for modeling and simulating collective behavior. Specific topics covered include: * analysis of wealth distributions * dynamics of price formation * spreading of opinions * models of social behavior * population dynamics * aggregation and swarming The topics presented point toward new and challenging frontiers of applied mathematics, making the volume a useful reference text for applied mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and economists involved in the modeling of socio-economic systems."
alma9947141690404105,,Might Global Uncertainty Promote International Trade?,"Baley, Isaac. and Veldkamp, Laura. and Waugh, Michael E.",2019,,,,,,,National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cambridge, Mass","Common wisdom dictates that uncertainty impedes trade--we show that uncertainty can fuel more trade in a simple general equilibrium trade model with information frictions. In equilibrium, increases in uncertainty increase both the mean and the variance in returns to exporting implying that trade can increase or decrease with uncertainty depending on preferences. Under general conditions on preferences, we characterize the importance of these forces using a sufficient statistics approach. Higher uncertainty leads to increases in trade because agents receive improved terms of trade, particularly in states of nature where consumption is most valuable. Trade creates value, in part, by offering a mechanism to share risk and risk sharing is most effective when both parties are uninformed."
alma9912678223004101,,The theory of incentives : the principal-agent model,"Laffont, Jean-Jacques and Martimort, David.",2002,,,,,,,Princeton University Press,"Princeton, N.J","Economics has much to do with incentives--not least, incentives to work hard, to produce quality products, to study, to invest, and to save. Although Adam Smith amply confirmed this more than two hundred years ago in his analysis of sharecropping contracts, only in recent decades has a theory begun to emerge to place the topic at the heart of economic thinking. In this book, Jean-Jacques Laffont and David Martimort present the most thorough yet accessible introduction to incentives theory to date. Central to this theory is a simple question as pivotal to modern-day management as it is to economics research: What makes people act in a particular way in an economic or business situation? In seeking an answer, the authors provide the methodological tools to design institutions that can ensure good incentives for economic agents. This book focuses on the principal-agent model, the ""simple"" situation where a principal, or company, delegates a task to a single agent through a contract--the essence of management and contract theory. How does the owner or manager of a firm align the objectives of its various members to maximize profits? Following a brief historical overview showing how the problem of incentives has come to the fore in the past two centuries, the authors devote the bulk of their work to exploring principal-agent models and various extensions thereof in light of three types of information problems: adverse selection, moral hazard, and non-verifiability. Offering an unprecedented look at a subject vital to industrial organization, labor economics, and behavioral economics, this book is set to become the definitive resource for students, researchers, and others who might find themselves pondering what contracts, and the incentives they embody, are really all about."

(Alan Geoffrey)",2016,,,,,,,John Wiley & Sons,"Chichester, UK ;","Geo-mathematical modelling: models from complexity science  Sir Alan Wilson, Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London  Mathematical and computer models for a complexity science tool kit  Geographical systems are characterised by locations, activities at locations, interactions between them and the infrastructures that carry these activities and flows. They can be described at a great variety of scales, from individuals and organisations to countries. Our understanding, often partial, of these entities, and in many cases this understanding is represented in theories and associated mathematical models.  In this book, the main examples are models that represent elements of the global system covering such topics as trade, migration, security and development aid together with examples at finer scales. This provides an effective toolkit that can not only be applied to global systems, but more widely in the modelling of complex systems. All complex systems involve nonlinearities involving path dependence and the possibility of phase changes and this makes the mathematical aspects particularly interesting. It is through these mechanisms that new structures can be seen to ‘emerge’, and hence the current notion of ‘emergent behaviour’. The range of models demonstrated include account-based models and biproportional fitting, structural dynamics, space-time statistical analysis, real-time response models, Lotka-Volterra models representing ‘war’, agent-based models, epidemiology and reaction-diffusion approaches, game theory, network models and finally, integrated models.  Geo-mathematical modelling: Presents mathematical models with spatial dimensions. Provides representations of path dependence and phase changes. Illustrates complexity science using models of trade, migration, security and development aid. Demonstrates how generic models from the complexity science tool kit can each be applied in a variety of situations  This book is for practitioners and researchers in applied mathematics, geography, economics, and interdisciplinary fields such as regional science and complexity science. It can also be used as the basis of a modelling course for postgraduate students."
alma9946902355204105,,Contesting trade in Central America : market reform and resistance,"Spalding, Rose J.",2014,,,,,,,University of Texas Press,Austin,"In 2004, the United States, five Central American countries, and the Dominican Republic signed the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), signaling the region’s commitment to a neoliberal economic model. For many, however, neoliberalism had lost its luster as the new century dawned, and resistance movements began to gather force. Contesting Trade in Central America is the first book-length study of the debate over CAFTA, tracing the agreement’s drafting, its passage, and its aftermath across Central America. Rose J. Spalding draws on nearly two hundred interviews with representatives from government, business, civil society, and social movements to analyze the relationship between the advance of free market reform in Central America and the parallel rise of resistance movements. She views this dynamic through the lens of Karl Polanyi’s “double movement” theory, which posits that significant shifts toward market economics will trigger oppositional, self-protective social countermovements. Examining the negotiations, political dynamics, and agents involved in the passage of CAFTA in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, Spalding argues that CAFTA served as a high-profile symbol against which Central American oppositions could rally. Ultimately, she writes, post-neoliberal reform “involves not just the design of appropriate policy mixes and sequences, but also the hard work of building sustainable and inclusive political coalitions, ones that prioritize the quality of social bonds over raw economic freedom.”"

It uses a version of the IMF's Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) that includes a copper sector. Two results are obtained. First, Chile's current fiscal rule performs well if the policymaker puts a small weight on output volatility (relative to inflation volatility) in his/her objective function. A more aggressive countercyclical fiscal rule can attain lower output volatility, but there is a trade-off with (somewhat) higher inflation volatility and (much) higher volatility of fiscal variables. Second, given its current stock of government assets, Chile's adoption of a 0.5% surplus target starting in 2008 is desirable from a business cycle perspective. This is because the earlier 1% target would have required significant further asset accumulation that could only have been accomplished at the expense of greater volatility in fiscal instruments and therefore in GDP."

Unlike scholars in mainstream neoclassical economics who explain economic development by quantitative growth models, this book attempts to understand economic progress in human agency perspective. In this approach, human agency is placed at the centre of economic analysis. This book begins with a review of the theories of economic development in the history of Austrian economics, with the intention of extending the contributions of major Austrian economists to development economics. After pointing out the weaknesses in the orthodox neoclassical approach to economic growth, the book then puts forward a subjectivist methodology which integrates the contributions of Max Weber, Alfred Schutz and Austrian Economists to interpret economic phenomena and policies. This chapter also serves as a methodological foundation for arguments elaborated in subsequent chapters. The rest of the book discusses important issues in economic development, namely, entrepreneurial process, national capabilities, innovation, trade, government, transition and catching up strategies for firms in latecomer economies. The book ends with concluding remarks and a proposal for a new research agenda in economic development. This book is well written, free from mathematics and is highly readable. It adds new insights not only in economics, but also in management, politics and social sciences. It will be useful to scholars, policy makers and students in economic development, entrepreneurship, theory of the firm, management of innovation, government policy, economic sociology, Austrian and evolutionary economics."

This collected volume represents the final outcome of the COST Action IS1104 “The EU in the new complex geography of economic systems: models, tools and policy evaluation”. Visualizing the EU as a complex and multi-layered network, the book is organized in three parts, each of them dealing with a different level of analysis: At the macro-level, Part I considers the interactions within large economic systems (regions or countries) involving trade, workers migration, and other factor movements. At the meso-level, Part II discusses interactions within specific but wide-ranging markets, with a focus on financial markets and banking systems. Lastly, at the micro-level, Part III explores the decision-making of single firms, especially in the context of location decisions."

The quartet of core and interlinked issues addressed are central to the requirements of policy makers and scholars who require robust methodologies for assessing the role played by innovation and environmental policy in determining economic performance. The volume examines the potential alternative uses of recently available hybrid economic-environmental accounting at meso-level, both for ex-ante and ex-post analysis. It studies the deployment of dynamics to explain the co-evolution of economic and environmental systems. The authors also explore how technological innovation drives sustainability goals, and demonstrate the importance of working at sector level rather than at aggregated national level.   Exploiting econometric techniques aimed at dealing with the dynamics of economic systems and the heterogeneity of agents performances, the volume integrates innovation-based reasoning with ex-post analyses, and presents ex-ante analyses able to evaluate the role of climate change policies by using computable general equilibrium models such as the Global Trade Analysis Project for Energy (GTAP-E). The authors merge and use a range of datasets, including OECD-PATSTAT and STAN, to test novel techniques informed by evolutionary economic theories and the Porter hypothesis. The immediate relevance and applicability of the models will strengthen the hand of policy analysts for whom the dynamic efficiency of environmental policy is a new, high-profile evaluation criterion."

Part I (Chapters 1-7) presents models of an economic agent, discussing abstract models of preferences, choice, and decision making under uncertainty, before turning to models of the consumer, the producer, and monopoly. Part II (Chapters 8-14) introduces the concept of equilibrium, beginning, unconventionally, with the models of the jungle and an economy with indivisible goods, and continuing with models of an exchange economy, equilibrium with rational expectations, and an economy with asymmetric information. Part III (Chapters 15-16) provides an introduction to game theory, covering strategic and extensive games and the concepts of Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect equilibrium. Part IV (Chapters 17-20) gives a taste of the topics of mechanism design, matching, the axiomatic analysis of economic systems, and social choice.  The book focuses on the concepts of model and equilibrium. It states models and results precisely, and provides proofs for all results. It uses only elementary mathematics (with almost no calculus), although many of the proofs involve sustained logical arguments. It includes about 150 exercises.  With its formal but accessible style, this textbook is designed for undergraduate students of microeconomics at intermediate and advanced levels. """

Yet automation is also expected to raise productivity and output. How can we share the gains from automation more widely, for the benefit of all? And what are the attendant equity-efficiency trade-offs? We analyze this issue by considering the effects of fiscal policies that seek to redistribute the gains from automation and address income inequality. We use a dynamic general equilibrium model with monopolistic competition, including a novel specification linking corporate power to automation. While fiscal policy cannot eliminate the classic equity-efficiency trade-offs, it can help improve them, reducing inequality at small or no loss of output. This is particularly so when policy takes advantage of novel, less distortive transmission channels of fiscal policy created by the empirically observed link between corporate market power and automation."

General equilibrium is the backbone of modern economic analysis, which is why generation after generation of economics students have been introduced to it. As an analytical tool, general equilibrium can provide one of the most complete views of a given economy, as it incorporates all economic agents (households, firms, government and the foreign sector) in an integrated way that explicitly reveals the interplay of economic forces—supply and demand—and the balancing role of prices.  Applied general equilibrium goes one step further in modeling, since it entails the integration of microeconomic theory, data handling and computing. This integration is essential for successful empirical modeling, but also involves various abilities that are not found in standard books. This book fills the gap, providing advanced students with the required tools, from the construction of consistent and applicable general equilibrium models to the interpretation of the results that ensue from the adoption of policies. This second edition expands the range of topics covered, including: indispensable general equilibrium theory, step-by-step model design, incremental model extensions, a wealth of sample computer code, procedures for constructing economic databases, database adjustments and database updating algorithms, numerical model calibration, policy strategies and their trade-offs and welfare effects, and a discussion of empirical policy examples."

This is certainly the case for the subject of this book, originally published in 1994, which explores the contribution that computer-based modelling and artificial intelligence can make to understanding fundamental issues in social science. Simulating Societies shows how computer simulations can help to clarify theoretical approaches, contribute to the evaluation of alternative theories, and illuminate one of the major issues of the social sciences: how social phenomena can ""emerge"" from individual action. The authors discuss how simulation models can be constructed using recently developed artificial intelligence techniques and they consider the methodological issues involved in using such models for theory development, testing and experiment. The introductory chapters situate the book within social science, and suggest why the time was ripe for significant progress, before defining basic terminology, showing how simulation has been used to theorize about organizations, and indicating through examples some of the fundamental issues involved in simulation. The main body of the text provides case studies drawn from economics, anthropology, archaeology, planning, social psychology and sociology.The appeal of this path-breaking book was twofold.

The model identifies a fundamental trade-off between (i) a ""displacement externality"" under non-integration, where a partner leaves a relationship even though the benefit is worth less than the loss to the displaced partner, and (ii), a ""retention externality"" under integration, where a partner inefficiently retains the other. Renegotiation cannot eliminate these inefficiencies when agents are wealth constrained. When there is more asset specificity, displacement externalities matter more and retention externality less, so that integration becomes more attractive. Our model also predicts that integration always provides stronger incentives for specific investments, and that wealthy owners actually want to commit to ex-post wealth constraints. Our analysis differs from the received theories of the firm because of our emphasis on dynamic partner changes."

P.,"Berkeley, CA","Technical debt is an often-overlooked problem that the software industry needs to take more seriously. All organizations are impacted by it, most wish that they had less of it, but need help in understanding the nature of the beast. This book aims to clear up any misconceptions and show you how to implement a sound technical debt management program to suit your company's needs. You'll learn the greatest challenge in solving the technical debt dilemma is not to find solutions to it, but rather to find solutions to the human and organizational issues that lead to that debt. For example, convincing senior stakeholders of the importance of addressing technical debt, getting stakeholders to acknowledge how their actions lead to unintentional debt, and enabling teams to prioritize technical debt over short-term goals. Therefore, this book is divided into three parts: defining technical debt, understanding technical debt, and tackling technical debt. It begins by explaining why technical debt should not be considered a technical problem, but rather a problem of how trade-off decisions are made. You'll then examine how making decisions using the affect heuristic, more commonly known as a ""gut feeling,"" can lead to unnecessary technical debt, followed by some techniques for combating your vulnerability to this trap. Reducing your organization's level of technical debt is not easy. Taming Your Dragon will show you how to implement a technical debt management program.

The main finding is that the composition of the consolidation, as determined by the mix of revenue and expenditure measures, has important implications for growth, employment, investment, and other key macroeconomic variables. A reduction in current expenditures yields the smallest GDP contraction in the short term and can increase output in the long term by stimulating labor participation and private investment. On the other end of the spectrum, a consolidation of government investment and corporate taxes are the most costly, as disincentives for private investment result in protracted declines in GDP that compound over time to GDP losses that are multiple times the initial size of the consolidation."

Fitting the model with forecasts by analysts, businesses and trade unions for South Africa, we find that inflation expectations have become increasingly strongly anchored. That is, the degree to which the estimated implicit anchor pins down inflation expectations at longer horizons has generally increased. Estimated inflation anchors of analysts lie within the 3–6 percent inflation target range of the central bank. However, the implicit anchors of businesses and trade unions, who are directly involved in the setting of wages and prices that drive the inflation process, have remained above the top end of the official target range.

While standard real options models assume that agents possess a constant rate of time preference, there is substantial evidence that agents are very impatient about choices in the short-term, but are quite patient when choosing between long-term alternatives. We extend the real options framework to model the investment timing decisions of entrepreneurs with such time-inconsistent preferences. Two opposing forces determine investment timing: while evolving uncertainty induces entrepreneurs to defer investment in order to take advantage of the option to wait, their time-inconsistent preferences motivate them to invest earlier in order to avoid the time-inconsistent behavior they will display in the future. We find that the precise trade-off between these two forces depends on such factors as whether entrepreneurs are sophisticated or naive in their expectations regarding their future time-inconsistent behavior, as well as whether the payoff from investment occurs all at once or over time. We extend the model to consider equilibrium investment behavior for an industry comprised of time-inconsistent entrepreneurs. Such an equilibrium involves the dual problem of entrepreneurs playing dynamic games against competitors as well as against their own future selves."

Using a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression model on an expanded data set, including sectoral balance sheet variables, we show that the balance sheets of various economic agents act as important links in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Balance sheets of financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks, asset-backed-security issuers and, to a lesser extent, security brokers and dealers, shrink in response to monetary tightening, while money market fund assets grow. The balance sheet effects are comparable in magnitude to the traditional interest rate channel. However, their economic significance in the run-up to the recent financial crisis was small.

We develop a general equilibrium model for a commodity-exporting economy where macro policies are conducted through rules. We show that the responses of output, aggregate demand, and inflation to an increase in commodity price are magnified when these rules are imperfectly credible and lack transparency. If policies are imperfectly credible, then transparency helps private agents to learn the systematic behavior of the authorities, reducing the effects of commodity prices shocks. Coherent with the model, we show cross-country evidence that monetary policy transparency and fiscal credibility reduce the incidence of export price volatility on output volatility. Also, our results indicate that having an explicit fiscal rule and an inflation targeting regime contribute to isolate the economy from terms of trade fluctuations."

With imperfect credit markets and a fixed cost of rent seeking, only wealthy agents choose to engage in it, since it enables them to protect their wealth from expropriation. Hence, the level of rent seeking and economic performance are determined by the initial distribution of income and wealth. When individuals also differ in their productivity, not all wealthy agents become rent seekers and the social costs of rent seeking are typically lower. In both cases, multiple equilibria with different levels of rent seeking and production are possible."

A number of financial sector measures were also instituted that distorted resource allocation and increased transaction costs. As a result, while possibly preventing the contraction of output in the early 1990s, these policies led to disappointing economic outcomes and social conditions. The paper reviews the underlying distortions and presents survey-based evidence to support their existence and their detrimental impact on economic activity. Looking forward, the paper-using a representative agent framework to model existing financial sector distortions-offers some guidance regarding the likely implications of eliminating the observed distortions on key aggregate variables. It suggests that the elimination of these distortions will enhance welfare and lead to increased investment and capital stock."

In 1993, the first volume provided the standard reference to this new approach in finance--an approach that, as editor Richard Thaler put it, ""entertains the possibility that some of the agents in the economy behave less than fully rationally some of the time."" Much has changed since then. Not least, the bursting of the Internet bubble and the subsequent market decline further demonstrated that financial markets often fail to behave as they would if trading were truly dominated by the fully rational investors who populate financial theories. Behavioral finance has made an indelible mark on areas from asset pricing to individual investor behavior to corporate finance, and continues to see exciting empirical and theoretical advances. Advances in Behavioral Finance, Volume II constitutes the essential new resource in the field. It presents twenty recent papers by leading specialists that illustrate the abiding power of behavioral finance--of how specific departures from fully rational decision making by individual market agents can provide explanations of otherwise puzzling market phenomena. As with the first volume, it reaches beyond the world of finance to suggest, powerfully, the importance of pursuing behavioral approaches to other areas of economic life. The contributors are Brad M.

There are two main results. First, real interest rate rigidities in a monopolistic banking system have an asymmetric impact on financial stability: they increase the probability of a financial crisis (relative to the case of flexible interest rate) in response to contractionary shocks to the economy, while they act as automatic macro-prudential stabilizers in response to expansionary shocks. Second, when the interest rate is the only available policy instrument, a monetary authority subject to the same constraints as private agents cannot always achieve a (constrained) efficient allocation and faces a trade-off between macroeconomic and financial stability in response to contractionary shocks. An implication of our analysis is that the weak link in the U.S. policy framework in the run up to the Global Recession was not excessively lax monetary policy after 2002, but rather the absence of an effective regulatory framework aimed at preserving financial stability."

For instance, why did Al Qaeda attack the World Trade Center whereas the African National Congress tried to avoid civilian bloodshed? Why does Islamic State brag over social media about its gory attacks, while Hezbollah denies responsibility or even apologizes for its carnage? This text shows that militant group behaviour depends on the tactical intelligence of the leaders. The author has extensively studied the political plights of hundreds of militant groups throughout world history and reveals that successful militant leaders have followed three rules. These rules are based on original insights from the fields of political science, psychology, criminology, economics, management, marketing, communication, and sociology. It turns out there's a science to victory in militant history. But even rebels must follow rules."

Cross-sectional econometric evidence shows that higher top income shares, and also financial liberalization, which is a common policy response to increases in income inequality, are associated with substantially larger external deficits. To study this mechanism we develop a DSGE model that features workers whose income share declines at the expense of investors. Loans to workers from domestic and foreign investors support aggregate demand and result in current account deficits. Financial liberalization helps workers smooth consumption, but at the cost of higher household debt and larger current account deficits. In emerging markets, workers cannot borrow from investors, who instead deploy their surplus funds abroad, leading to current account surpluses instead of deficits."

The paper employs panel regression and panel vector autoregression (VAR) on 155 countries of which 42 are microstates. Panel regression results show that a percentage point improvement in the fiscal balance improves the current account balance by 0.4 percentage points of GDP. The real effective exchange rate has no significant impact on the current account in microstates but the coefficient is significant in the global sample. Panel VAR results show that an increase in government consumption results in real exchange appreciation but the effect on the current account after an initial deterioration dies out quicker in microstates than in the global sample. The result implies that fiscal policy has little effect on the current account in microstates beyond its direct impact on imports. Overall, the results suggest that the weak relative price effects make the effect of fiscal adjustment on the current account much more difficult in microstates."

When did the Marlboro Man become a symbol of American masculinity? Why do Americans love to dress down in high-tech Lycra fabrics, while they wax nostalgic for quaint, old-fashioned Victorian cottages? Fashion icons and failures have long captivated the general public, but few scholars have examined the historical role of business and commerce in creating the international market for style goods. Producing Fashion is a groundbreaking collection of original essays that shows how economic institutions in Europe and North America laid the foundation for the global fashion system and sustained it commercially through the mechanisms of advertising, licensing, marketing, publishing, and retailing. The collection reveals how public and private institutions-from government censors in imperial Russia to large corporations in the United States-worked to shape fashion, style, and taste with varying degrees of success. Fourteen contributors draw on original research and fresh insight into the producers of fashion-advertising agents, architects, corporate executives, department stores, designers, editors, government officials, hairdressers, haute couturiers, and Web retailers-in their bid for influence, acclaim, and shoppers' dollars. Producing Fashion looks to the past, revealing the rationale behind style choices, while explaining how the interplay of custom, invented traditions, and sales imperatives continue to drive innovation in the fashion industries."

The cost to firms of evading taxes is that they find themselves subject to credit rationing from banks. Our model simulations show that in the absence of budgetary flexibility to adjust expenditures, raising tax rates too high drives firms into the underground economy, thereby reducing the tax base. Aggregate investment in the economy is lowered because of credit rationing. Taxes that are too low eliminate the underground economy, but result in unsustainable budget and trade deficits. Thus, the optimal rate of taxation, from a macroeconomic point of view, may lead to some underground activity."
alma9912568102404101,,Lectures on Behavioral Macroeconomics,"Grauwe, Paul de",2012,,,,,,,Princeton University Press,"Princeton, NJ","In mainstream economics, and particularly in New Keynesian macroeconomics, the booms and busts that characterize capitalism arise because of large external shocks. The combination of these shocks and the slow adjustments of wages and prices by rational agents leads to cyclical movements. In this book, Paul De Grauwe argues for a different macroeconomics model--one that works with an internal explanation of the business cycle and factors in agents' limited cognitive abilities. By creating a behavioral model that is not dependent on the prevailing concept of rationality, De Grauwe is better able to explain the fluctuations of economic activity that are an endemic feature of market economies. This new approach illustrates a richer macroeconomic dynamic that provides for a better understanding of fluctuations in output and inflation. De Grauwe shows that the behavioral model is driven by self-fulfilling waves of optimism and pessimism, or animal spirits. Booms and busts in economic activity are therefore natural outcomes of a behavioral model. The author uses this to analyze central issues in monetary policies, such as output stabilization, before extending his investigation into asset markets and more sophisticated forecasting rules. He also examines how well the theoretical predictions of the behavioral model perform when confronted with empirical data. Develops a behavioral macroeconomic model that assumes agents have limited cognitive abilities Shows how booms and busts are characteristic of market economies Explores the larger role of the central bank in the behavioral model Examines the destabilizing aspects of asset markets"

They are analytically combined in an integrative framework starting from a core insight: in its approach to multilingualism, Europe is pursuing two equally worthy, but non-converging goals, namely, the mobility of citizens across national boundaries (and hence across languages and cultures) and the preservation of Europe's diversity, which presupposes that each local nurtures its linguistic and cultural uniqueness, and has the means to include newcomers in its specific linguistic and cultural environment.

We find a strong negative relationship between the degree of informality and the size of the fiscal multiplier. This result holds irrespective of the levels of economic development and institutional quality and is robust to additional country characteristics such as trade, financial openness and exchange rate regime. In a two-sector new- Keynesian model, we rationalize this result by showing that fiscal shocks raise the relative price of official goods, shifting demand towards the informal sector. This reallocation effect increases with the level of informality, because a larger informal sector is associated with a stronger appreciation of relative prices in response to fiscal shocks. Thus, informality raises the size of the unofficial multiplier. A higher degree of non-separability between public and private goods also contributes to rationalize the lower multipliers in high-informality countries."

Moreover, temporarily sticky nominal goods prices can have large effects on equity portfolios even when dividend processes are very persistent."

""We have a problem with your passport. Can we move please to another room to discuss something?"" Ghosn never saw it coming. In Japan it's called the ""Ghosn Shock""-the stunning arrest of Carlos Ghosn, the jet-setting CEO who saved Nissan and made it part of a global automotive empire. Even more shocking was his daring escape from Japan, packed into a box and put on a private jet to Lebanon after months spent in a Japanese detention center, subsisting on rice gruel. How did it come to this, and why? This is the sprawling story of what led to the Ghosn Shock and what was left in its wake. The book chronicles Ghosn's two decades building a colossal partnership between Nissan and Renault. To the world it looked like a new model for a global business, but the alliance's shiny image fronted an unsteady, tense operation. Culture clashes, infighting among executives and engineers, dueling corporate traditions, and government maneuvering constantly threatened the venture. Tokyo-based journalists Hans Greimel and William Sposato have followed, up close, Ghosn's two-decade career in Japan and have witnessed the end of the Japanese bubble economy and botched attempts at opening Japan Inc. to the world. They've seen the fraying of keiretsu, Japan's traditional skein of business relationships, and covered a number of corporate scandals, of which the Ghosn Shock ranks number one. Expertly reported, Collision Course explores the complex suspicions around what and who was really responsible for Ghosn's ouster. It explains how economics, history, national interests, legal traditions, and hubris converged on arguably the most important foreign businessman ever to set foot in Japan.

W.",2018,,,,,,,Routledge,London,"""Over the past forty years, East Asia has been radically transformed from a war damaged sub-continent to a region of global pre-eminence. With new, highly developed scientific resources, great economic strengths, significant global trading links and equally powerful financial resources, East Asia is now one of the most dynamic regions in the global system. This book illuminates the historical development trajectory and contemporary circumstances of the countries of the region. Embracing a cross-disciplinary perspective, it summarises the history of the region and goes on to focus upon the rise of East Asia since the ruins of the Pacific War. Analysing the region's basic strengths and the distinctive elite development strategies across the various countries, it also examines areas of domestic, intra-regional and international conflict. It covers the basic ground of political economy, society, culture and politics, whilst also taking care to locate the contemporary region in its own history and asking, what further change can be expected in the future?Providing an excellent introduction to the study of the region, this book is an important read for students and scholars of East Asian politics, history and development.""

E.",2001,,,,,,,Princeton University Press,"Princeton, N.J","Why has postwar Japanese abortion policy been relatively progressive, while contraception policy has been relatively conservative? The Japanese government legalized abortion in 1948 but did not approve the pill until 1999. In this carefully researched study, Tiana Norgren argues that these contradictory policies flowed from very different historical circumstances and interest group configurations. Doctors and family planners used a small window of opportunity during the Occupation to legalize abortion, and afterwards, doctors and women battled religious groups to uphold the law. The pill, on the other hand, first appeared at an inauspicious moment in history. Until circumstances began to change in the mid-1980s, the pharmaceutical industry was the pill's lone champion: doctors, midwives, family planners, and women all opposed the pill as a potential threat to their livelihoods, abortion rights, and women's health. Clearly written and interwoven with often surprising facts about Japanese history and politics, Norgren's book fills vital gaps in the cross-national literature on the politics of reproduction, a subject that has received more attention in the European and American contexts. Abortion Before Birth Control will be a valuable resource for those interested in abortion and contraception policies, gender studies, modern Japanese history, political science, and public policy."

Firms borrow funds from the banking system in an economy regulated by a central bank. The central bank carries out monetary policy, by setting the interest rate, and prudential regulation, by establishing the banking capital requirement. Different combinations of interest rate rule and capital requirement rule are evaluated with respect to both macroeconomic and financial stability. Several relevant policy implications were drawn. First, the efficacy of a given capital requirement rule or interest rate rule depends on the specification of the rule of the other type it is combined with. More precisely, less aggressive interest rate rules perform better when the range of variation of the capital requirement is narrower. Second, interest rate smoothing is more effective than the other interest rate rules assessed, as it outperforms those other rules with respect to financial stability and macroeconomic stability. Third, there is no tradeoff between financial and macroeconomic stability associated with a variation of either the capital requirement or the smoothing interest rate parameter. Finally, our results reinforce the cautionary finding of other studies regarding how output can be ravaged by a low inflation targeting."

Applying agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) methodology, this paper analyzes the impact of alternative production–sales policies on the diffusion of a new generic product and the generated NPV of profit. The key features of the ABMS model, that captures the marketplace as a complex adaptive system, are: (i) supply chain capacity is constrained; (ii) consumers’ new product adoption decisions are influenced by marketing activities as well as positive and negative word-of-mouth (WOM) between consumers; (iii) interactions among consumers taking place in the context of their social network are captured at the individual level; and (iv) the new product adoption process is adaptive. Conducting over 1 million simulation experiments, we determined the “best” production–sales policies under various parameter combinations based on the NPV of profit generated over the diffusion process. The key findings are as follows: (1) on average, the build-up policy with delayed marketing is the preferred policy in the case of only positive WOM as well as the case of positive and negative WOM. This policy provides the highest expected NPV of profit on average and it also performs very smoothly with respect to changes in build-up periods. (2) It is critical to consider the significant impact of negative word-of-mouth in choosing production–sales policies. Neglecting the effect of negative word-of-mouth can lead to poor policy recommendations, incorrect conclusions concerning the impact of operational parameters on the policy choice, and suboptimal choice of build-up periods."

Driven by concerns of privacy, national security, surveillance, and cyber terrorism, governments around the world have been erecting barriers in cyberspace through data localization. The extent of data localization varies from free flow of data, to stringent restrictions requiring all data to be stored only within the territorial jurisdiction of the country. Though there are certain legitimate concerns regarding protection of personal data, scholars and liberal economists have long proclaimed that any restrictions on the Internet and associated digital trade will have serious economic consequences. Data localization affects digital trade between consumers and producers of digital services to varying degrees. In this paper, we use agent based modeling to study the properties and behaviours of consumers and producers under varying data localization regimes. An augmented gravity model of trade with iceberg coefficient is incorporated to reflect distance-related costs between producers and consumers. Varying data localization compliance costs are included to reflect the effect of non-tariff barriers of data restrictions. Our extensive simulations indicate that there is often clustering of consumers around local firms in highly restrictive data localization regimes, thus enabling local firms to effectively compete against global multinationals. However, results also indicate that while free cross-border data flow enables intense competition amongst producers, data localization restrictions often limit consumer choice due to its effect on price and quality of services. •Data localization affects digital trade between consumers and producers to varying degrees.•An augmented gravity model of trade is used to reflect distance-related costs between producers and consumers.•Varying data localization compliance costs are included to reflect the effect of non-tariff barriers of data restrictions.•Results indicate clustering of consumers around local firms in highly restrictive data localization regimes."

Background: Previous analyses of food hub dynamics focused primarily on financial drivers rather than social factors and have not used mathematical models. Method: Based on qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 22 customers and 11 vendors at a midwestern food hub, an agent-based model (ABM) was created with distinct consumer personas characterizing the range of consumer priorities. A comparison study determined if the ABM behaved differently than a model based on traditional economic assumptions. Further simulation studies assessed the effect of changes in parameters, such as producer reliability and the consumer profiles, on long-term food hub sustainability. Results: The persona-based ABM model produced different and more resilient results than the more traditional way of modeling consumers. Reduced producer reliability significantly reduced trade; in some instances, a modest reduction in reliability threatened the sustainability of the system. Finally, a modest increase in price-driven consumers at the outset of the simulation quickly resulted in those consumers becoming a majority of the overall customer base. Conclusion: Results suggest that social factors, such as desire to support the community, can be more important than financial factors. Application: An ABM of food hub dynamics, based on human factors data gathered from the field, can be a useful tool for policy decisions. Similar approaches can be used for modeling customer dynamics with other sustainable organizations."

The prime objective is to determine how team problem solving varies between an organized and disorganized environment also considering motivational aspects. Design/methodology/approach Using agent-based modeling, the authors use a real-world data set from 226 volunteers at five different types of non-profit organizations in Southwest England to define some attributes of the agents. The authors introduce the concepts of natural, structural and functional disorganization while operationalizing natural and functional disorganization. Findings The simulations show that “disorganization” is more conducive for problem solving efficiency than “organization” given enough flexibility (range) to search and acquire resources. The findings further demonstrate that teams with resources above their hierarchical level (access to better quality resources) tend to perform better than teams that have only limited access to resources. Originality/value The nuanced categories of “(dis-)organization” allow us to compare between various structural limitations, thus generating insights for improving the way managers structure teams for better problem solving."

Objectives This study aimed to develop a model that spatially represents a complex human–environment (H–E) system consisting of heterogeneous social–ecological components and feedback mechanisms at multiple scales, in order to assess multi-dimensional (spatial, temporal, and social) trade-offs in ecosystem services. Methods We constructed an agent-based model and empirically calibrated it for a semi-arid region in Northeast China, and examined ecosystem service trade-offs derived from the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), which is based on payment for ecosystem services. This paper describes our model, named Inner Mongolia Land Use Dynamic Simulator (IM-LUDAS), using the overview, design concepts, and details + decision (ODD + D) protocol and demonstrates the capabilities of IM-LUDAS through simulations. Results IM-LUDAS represented typical characteristics of complex H–E systems, such as secondary and cross-scale feedback loops, time lags, and threshold change, revealing the following results: tree plantations expanded by the SLCP facilitated vegetation and soil restoration and household change toward off-farm livelihoods, as expected by the government; conversely, the program caused further land degradation outside the implementation plots; moreover, the livelihood changes were not large enough to compensate for income deterioration by policy-induced reduction in cropland. Conclusions IM-LUDAS proved itself to be an advanced empirical model that can recreate essential features of complex H–E systems and assess multi-dimensional trade-offs in ecosystem services."

This has resulted in negative consequences for the world economy, partly causing international food price spikes and social upheavals. In this paper we present statistical findings along with a preliminary version of an original agent-based model called the Dawe Global Security Model that simulates the global food market and the political fragility of countries. The model simulates the effects of food insecurity on international food prices and how these, coupled with national political fragility and international food trade can, in turn, increase the probability of food riots in countries. The agents in the model are the 213 countries of the world whose characteristics reflect empirical data and the international trade of food is also simulated based on real trade partnerships and data. The model has been informed, calibrated and validated using real data and the results of these procedures are presented in the paper. To further test the model we also present the model’s forecasts for the near future in terms of food prices and incidence of food riots. The Dawe Global Security Model can be used to test scenarios on the evolution of shocks to global food production and analyse consequences for food riots. Further developments of the model can include national responses to food crises to investigate how countries can influence the spread of global food crises."

This study focuses on the positioning strategy of MNEs to understand the impact of their R&D location strategy. In ABS modeling, agents search for knowledge owners or universities in the global host market using Hotelling’s location model algorithm. We measure the result of increasing the number of entry agents from 2 to 121. Three types of equilibria are found in our agent-based simulation model: pure equilibrium, saturated equilibrium, and quasi-saturated equilibrium. Core locations attract MNEs, while peripheral countries in the global market are the least preferred. As a result, peripheral countries experience a paucity of foreign R&D investments. Even though emerging economies absorb foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from MNEs, least-less developed countries (LLDC) may experience a dearth in FDI. Thus, the optimal location strategy of MNEs leads to economic disparities between the core and peripheral countries. This study suggests the need for developing official assistance to attract FDI inflows to LLDCs so that peripheral countries emerge as attractive global market destinations for MNEs."
deWildtTristanE.2021Aeaa,,An ex ante assessment of value conflicts and social acceptance of sustainable heating systems An agent-based modelling approach,"de Wildt, Tristan E. and Boijmans, Anne R. and Chappin, Emile J. L. and Herder, Paulien M.",2021,Energy policy,153,,1-,,,Elsevier,OXFORD,"This paper demonstrates an approach to assess, ex ante, the social acceptance of sustainable heating systems in city districts. More sustainable heating systems are required in city districts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these systems may lack social acceptance as they often require significant adjustments to homes and may lead to a noticeable loss of in-home thermal comfort. Predicting social acceptance is often difficult due to the long-term planning horizon for energy systems. It is therefore unclear which design requirements and policy guidelines need to be specified ex ante. We suggest an approach to anticipate social acceptance by identifying value conflicts embedded in sustainable heating systems in specific social settings. These value conflicts might cause a lack of social acceptance over time due to value change. We demonstrate this approach using a case of community-driven heating initiative in The Hague, the Netherlands. We identify value conflicts embedded in various sustainable heating systems using an agent-based model. We formulate scenarios of value change to understand the severity of resulting social acceptance issues and discuss suitable heating systems for the city district. The approach can be used to support the decision-making process of policymakers at the local level, even in situations of limited local expertise."

To that end, we develop an agent-based model (ABM) with two types of firms: downstream firms, which produce a final good for consumption purposes using intermediate goods, and upstream firms, which produce and supply those intermediate goods to the downstream firms. Upstream firms can act as trade credit suppliers, by allowing delayed payment of a share of their sales to downstream firms. Our results suggest a potential trade-off between financial robustness as measured by the proportion of non-performing loans and the average output level. The intuitive reason is that greater availability of trade credit, which however does not necessarily imply proportionately greater actual use of it by downstream firms, allows more financial resources to remain in the real sector, favoring the latter's financial robustness. Yet, given that trade credit is proportionally more beneficial to smaller downstream firms, it enhances market competition. This results in a decrease in markups and thereby in profits and dividends, which contributes negatively to aggregate demand formation."
NamatameAkira2016AMaN,,Agent-Based Modeling and Network Dynamics,"Namatame, Akira and Chen, Shu-Heng",2016,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,Oxford,"The book integrates agent-based modeling and network science. It is divided into three parts, namely, foundations, primary dynamics on and of social networks, and applications. The book begins with the network origin of agent-based models, known as cellular automata, and introduce a number of classic models, such as Schelling’s segregation model and Axelrod’s spatial game. The essence of the foundation part is the network-based agent-based models in which agents follow network-based decision rules. Under the influence of the substantial progress in network science in late 1990s, these models have been extended from using lattices into using small-world networks, scale-free networks, etc. The book also shows that the modern network science mainly driven by game-theorists and sociophysicists has inspired agent-based social scientists to develop alternative formation algorithms, known as agent-based social networks. The book reviews a number of pioneering and representative models in this family. Upon the given foundation, the second part reviews three primary forms of network dynamics, i.e., diffusions, cascades, and influences. These primary dynamics are further extended and enriched by practical networks in goods-and-service markets, labor markets, and international trade. The book ends with two challenging issues using agent-based models of networks, i.e., network risks and economic growth."

The debate on the performance of the two systems has lasted for decades but still calls for attention in both research and practice. This paper compares water users' behavior under AS and MS through a consistent agent-based modeling framework for water allocation analysis that incorporates variables particular to both MS (e.g., water trade and trading prices) and AS (water use violations and penalties/subsidies). Analogous to the economic theory of water markets under MS, the theory of rational violation justifies the exchange of entitled water under AS through the use of cross-subsidies. Under water stress conditions, a unique water allocation equilibrium can be achieved by following a simple bargaining rule that does not depend upon initial market prices under MS, or initial economic incentives under AS. The modeling analysis shows that the behavior of water users (agents) depends on transaction, or administrative, costs, as well as their autonomy. Reducing transaction costs under MS or administrative costs under AS will mitigate the effect that equity constraints (originating with primary water allocation) have on the system's total net economic benefits. Moreover, hydrologic uncertainty is shown to increase market prices under MS and penalties/subsidies under AS and, in most cases, also increases transaction, or administrative, costs. ► A comparison between AS and MS is presented using a consistent agent-based modeling framework for water allocation. ► The theory of rational violation justifies the exchange of entitled water by cross-subsidies. ► The total benefit of the whole system is derived, which shows the three ways of improving it. ► Hydrologic uncertainty is shown to increase transaction or administrative costs."

Design/methodology/approach-The research approach is theoretically based on CAS with agent-based modelling (ABM) as the implementation method. A case study is presented where an agent-based model has contributed to increased understanding and precision in decision making at a packaging company in the UK. Findings-The results suggest that ABM provides decision-makers with robust and accurate ""what-if"" scenarios of the dynamic interplay among several business functions. These scenarios can guide managers in the process of moving from policy space to performance space, i.e. concerning priorities of improvement efforts and choices of production/manufacturing policies, warehouse policies, customer service policies and logistics policies. Furthermore, it is found that ABM can include and pay attention to several aspects of CAS and thus provide understanding of, and explanation for, the patterns and effects which emerge in manufacturing and logistics settings. Practical implications-Aided by agent-based models and simulations, practitioners' levels of intuition can be enhanced since patterns on the macro level emerge from agents' interactive behaviour. Together with insights from CAS these emergent patterns can be explained and understood, and are thus beneficial for the improvement of decision making in companies. Originality/value-The case presented distinguishes this paper from what has been written in previous articles on the application of ABM, since such articles have not produced any empirically verified results after implementation of ABM."

However, the extent to which archaeological and historical sources of inter-regional trade reflect the degree of economic integration is still not fully understood, a question which lies at the heart of current debates in Roman Studies. Ceramic tableware offers one of the only comparable and quantifiable sources of information for Roman inter-regional trade over centuries-long time periods. The distribution patterns and stylistic features of tablewares from the East Mediterranean dated between 200 BC and AD 300 suggest a competitive market where buying decisions might have been influenced by access to reliable commercial information. We contribute to this debate by representing three competing hypotheses in an agent-based model: success-biased social learning of tableware buying strategies (requiring access to reliable commercial information from all traders), unbiased social learning (requiring limited access), and independent learning (requiring no access). We use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to evaluate which hypothesis best describes archaeologically observed tableware distribution patterns. Our results revealed success-bias is not a viable theory and we demonstrate instead that local innovation (independent learning) is a plausible driving factor in inter-regional tableware trade. We also suggest that tableware distribution should instead be explored as a small component of long-distance trade cargoes dominated by foodstuffs, metals, and building materials."

We present a baseline agent-based model imitating the operations of a real-world retailer. We then introduce electric vans into our model in order to ascertain how charging power and charging strategy influence the retailer’s operations. Even though electric vans cannot match the performance of diesel vehicles using the same fleet size, our simulation experiments suggest that, by considering the quantity of orders and the geographical distribution of its customers, an operator can determine a suitable charging strategy that can minimise late delivery. Additionally, by employing a suitable charging strategy, an operator might avoid making unnecessary investments and reduce the barriers for electric vehicle adoption."

In this paper, we will estimate the possible impact on a Supply Chain of constructing a Hyperloop line for goods transportation. We develop an agent-based model of a simple Supply Chain system to simulate the introduction of a faster transport line. We observed that a positive relationship exists between the introduction of a faster line and the performance of the firms near the cities connected by the new line.

On the second level, the consequences of successful innovations and imitations in a given sector of economic activities are dealt with (Section  3 ). This depends on the frequency of successful novelties and on the way they diffuse in that sector. We use an agent-related functional approach, applying difference equations for depicting the stylized facts of the diffusion dynamics. Only if these different levels of economic dynamics are distinguished as well as related to each other, is it possible to derive aggregate effects of novelties for the whole economy. This will be done by way of computer simulations (Section  4 ). Conclusions are drawn in Section  5 ."

Nevertheless, the interaction between the markets for oilseeds (food/feed/bioenergy) and liquid vegetable oil-based biofuels is overwhelmingly complex and thus not well understood. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to provide insights into the effect of farmers' behaviour on trade flows and biodiesel production and to shed light on the influence of import tariffs for both palm oil and biodiesel on system behaviour. This new approach enables us to assess different types of rational economic behaviour for the adoption of crops by farmers. Results show that model outcomes can vary substantially based on the assumptions made concerning the behaviour of farmers. Moreover, we found that biodiesel trade and production are more sensitive to a change in the EU-28's biodiesel import tariff than to a change in the EU-28's palm oil import tariff. Overall, our results show that social processes, actors' heterogeneity, and institutions play an important role in the behaviour of the system. •Assumptions on farmers' rational economic behaviour affect trade flows of palm oil.•Biodiesel supply is more sensitive to import tariff on biodiesel than on palm oil.•Social processes, actor heterogeneity, and institutions are key to system behaviour."

This paper employs agent-based modeling (ABM) approach to simulate a local groundwater market in central Iran. The proposed ABM framework couples social, economic, and hydrological sub-models. The social sub-model benefits from the theory of planned behavior under field studies to design psychology-based behaviors of trading agents. Moreover, in continuous interaction with the FlowLogo hydrological sub-model, the economic sub-model simulates the inter-sectoral water trading under a double-auction mechanism. The inter-sectoral trading includes selling the farms' irrigation water to the industry sector. The calibration and validation results for an eight-year simulation period (2010–2018) confirm the acceptable performance of the proposed ABM framework. Water trading patterns experience relatively extreme variations in the first years. However, with the adaption of the agents' bids to the market conditions, they gradually emerge in a more stable form in the last years. Furthermore, updating the psychological factors increases the agents' intention of participating in the market, and thus, the competition level over time. Finally, the hydro-economic analysis reveals that implementing the dynamic cap-and-trade policy increases the total net benefits of market participants by an average of 27% per year while reducing the region's groundwater drawdown by 56 cm. Such inter-sectoral water markets can help with the sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources.

In the simultaneous strategy, all residents are informed to evacuate simultaneously, whereas in the staged evacuation strategy, residents in different zones are organized to evacuate in an order based on different sequences of the zones within the affected area. This study uses an agent-based technique to model traffic flows at the level of individual vehicles and investigates the collective behaviours of evacuating vehicles. We conducted simulations using a microscopic simulation system called Paramics on three types of road network structures under different population densities. The three types of road network structures include a grid road structure, a ring road structure, and a real road structure from the City of San Marcos, Texas. Default rules in Paramics were used for trip generation, destination choice, and route choice. Simulation results indicate that (1) there is no evacuation strategy that can be considered as the best strategy across different road network structures, and the performance of the strategies depends on both road network structure and population density; (2) if the population density in the affected area is high and the underlying road network structure is a grid structure, then a staged evacuation strategy that alternates non-adjacent zones in the affected area is effective in reducing the overall evacuation time."

Though sharing a similar practice form, the emission trading scheme is distinguished from traditional financial markets: firms coordinate three abatement options at the micro level, including allowance trading, output adjustment, and low-carbon technology adoption. Then, at the macro level, this leads to dynamic interactions among allowance market, output market, and low-carbon technology diffusion. This is the fundamental characteristic of the emission trading scheme, and modeling the dynamics behind is a major difficulty for relevant studies, especially when following complexities are considered: (1) different planning horizons of the three abatement options, (2) heterogeneity among sectors and firms, and (3) details of firms’ production and optional low-carbon technologies. Aiming at this difficulty, we establish an agent-based model for the emission trading scheme, and within a novel multi-level time frame, the fundamental characteristic is reflected and the complexities are considered. Firms’ production and low-carbon technologies are discretely modeled at a process level from a bottom-up perspective, and based on European data, our model is calibrated to cover 5 industrial sectors, 11 emission-intensive products, 25 production processes, and 52 low-carbon technologies. With this model, the emergence properties and uncertainty of the system are captured, and the non-linear impact of the abatement target is reflected and discussed. We find that, after a certain level, higher target leads to lower allowance price uncertainty but stronger output impact, which is a trade-off for setting the abatement target."

Epidemic simulation models and pandemic control methods are designed to tackle this problem. However, most of the existing approaches cannot be applied to real-world cases due to the lack of adaptability to new scenarios and micro representational ability (especially for system dynamics models), the huge computation demand, and the inefficient use of historical information. Methods We propose a novel Pandemic Control decision making framework via large-scale Agent-based modeling and deep Reinforcement learning (PaCAR) to search optimal control policies that can simultaneously minimize the spread of infection and the government restrictions. In the framework, we develop a new large-scale agent-based simulator with vaccine settings implemented to be calibrated and serve as a realistic environment for a city or a state. We also design a novel reinforcement learning architecture applicable to the pandemic control problem, with a reward carefully designed by the net monetary benefit framework and a sequence learning network to extract information from the sequential epidemiological observations, such as number of cases, vaccination, and so forth. Results Our approach outperforms the baselines designed by experts or adopted by real-world governments and is flexible in dealing with different variants, such as Alpha and Delta in COVID-19. PaCAR succeeds in controlling the pandemic with the lowest economic costs and relatively short epidemic duration and few cases. We further conduct extensive experiments to analyze the reasoning behind the resulting policy sequence and try to conclude this as an informative reference for policy makers in the post-vaccination era of COVID-19 and beyond. Limitations The modeling of economic costs, which are directly estimated by the level of government restrictions, is rather simple. This article mainly focuses on several specific control methods and single-wave pandemic control. Conclusions The proposed framework PaCAR can offer adaptive pandemic control recommendations on different variants and population sizes. Intelligent pandemic control empowered by artificial intelligence may help us make it through the current COVID-19 and other possible pandemics in the future with less cost both of lives and economy. Highlights We introduce a new efficient, large-scale agent-based epidemic simulator in our framework PaCAR, which can be applied to train reinforcement learning networks in a real-world scenario with a population of more than 10,000,000. We develop a novel learning mechanism in PaCAR, which augments reinforcement learning with sequence learning, to learn the tradeoff policy decision of saving lives and economic development in the post-vaccination era. We demonstrate that the policy learned by PaCAR outperforms different benchmark policies under various reality conditions during COVID-19. We analyze the resulting policy given by PaCAR, and the lessons may shed light on better pandemic preparedness plans in the future."

Decisions should derive from a trade-off between the optimal solution and the most accepted one. Models and simulations are typically used as decision-support tools for technical/economic analyses. This paper proposes a novel modelling approach for a stakeholder analysis, aimed at investigating the complex phenomenon of consensus formation and the collective behaviour that can emerge from an interaction process. Agent-based models (ABMs) are used to reproduce the opinion dynamics on stakeholder networks, by representing single stakeholders (i.e. agents) endowed with certain characteristics (e.g. opinion, influence) and interacting with each other according to simple behavioural rules with the aim to find a convergence of opinions. The implemented models are described according to their main features, and the results of tailored participation experiments built with the help of multi-criteria decision-making methods are presented and compared to those derived from simulations, representing a first step towards model validation. The methodology proposed provides insight on the dynamics of social interaction and the emergent phenomena that can derive from participation processes. The implemented models can be used to help decision-makers and practitioners to support the design of efficient participation processes, and to deal with multiple stakeholders and complex issues regarding transport decisions."

Food markets, supplied through both domestic production and international trade, are governed by several risks emerging from unpredictable supply chain disruptions, volatility of commodity prices, along with other unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters. To mitigate the challenges threatening the stability of food systems, decision-making within the food sector should be enhanced and robust to accommodate any changes that might cause food shortages. Dynamic models, that can predict the behavior of food systems in order to avoid potential future knock-on effects and deficits, are incumbent to ensure the sustainable performance of food systems. This study proposes a dynamic decision-making scheme that simulates strategies of the perishable food market under different circumstances. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed and implemented using python MESA library for a case study in Qatar, illustrating the potential performance of tomato under three different scenarios to be considered, namely: (a) baseline scenario - aiming to reflect current production and market conditions; (b) water resource efficiency scenario - basing decisions on crop water requirement (CWR) depending on weather conditions; and (c) economic risk scenario - applying the concept of forward contracts to hedge against future uncertainties in crop prices. The findings of this study demonstrate that under the baseline conditions, a tomato crop can be supplied through a combination of domestic production and imports depending on the available inventories and prices imposed by exporters. The results obtained for the CWR scenario suggest the need for total reliance on imports in order to meet domestic demand, as there is potentially high-water loss, which amounts to an average of 4.9 Billion m3 per year, if tomato is grown locally. In contrast, the results from the forward contract scenario recommend a 57% dependency on local production in order to mitigate the effects of volatility in global food prices, which contributes to a 63% reduction in environmental emissions. Findings of this research provide insight into the factors that influence strategic decision making by the food sector to enhance its economic and environmental performances under diverse circumstances. •A dynamic decision-making framework to ensure consistent availability of food is developed.•An agent-based simulated is used to advise the strategic planning of tomato crops supply in Qatar.•Three scenarios are investigated to demonstrate the impact of crop water requirement and forward contracts on strategies of the food sector.•A yearly average of 4.9 Bm3 is globally saved when the water requirement is considered in the decision-making.•A reduction of 63% in environmental emissions is recorded while adopting forward contracts."

The modelling scheme benefits from a distributed groundwater model coupled with a socio-economic ABM to explore the social and economic impacts of the proposed supply enhancement and demand management strategies. The main goal of the integrated model is to investigate how the supply enhancement strategies and the cap-and-trade policy can bring about more favourable hydrological, social, and economic results in the recipient basin. Findings indicate that integration of the supply augmentation and the cap-and-trade policy can facilitate the emergence of collective action in the farmer society. It is shown that the combination of these two policies, when implemented to mitigate water scarcity, reduces economic costs incurred on both farmers and the government and brings about more favourable socio-hydrological outcomes."

With this model, we simulate patterns of migration under four weather regimes in a rice economy: (1) a reference, ""normal"" scenario; (2) 7 years of unusually wet weather; (3) 7 years of unusually dry weather; and (4) 7 years of extremely variable weather. Results show relatively small impacts on migration. Experiments with the model show that existin high migration rates and strong selection factors, which are unaffected by climate change, are likely responsible for the weak migration response."

We adjusted the emission baseline, reduction target proportion, and trading platform under the scheme and simulated the emission reduction and trading behavior of each type of pollutant in different cases. Based on the comparative results of the modeling schemes analyzed in this paper, it is suggested that to improve the distribution of reduction targets without including trading systems can result in the most reduction amount in the study regions. Compared with an approach that includes a trading system, the proposed method provides a simple approach without any obvious increase in the reduction objects' average cost per unit of reduction. However, this approach makes it difficult for newly proposed investment projects to settle in the region to acquire the offset; therefore, an alternative measure should be designed for this purpose in such a case. When policy-makers default on making decisions based on air emission caps, a reduction scheme based on a supported trading system will be more adaptable for economic development. It is recommended to consider the maximum emission of the previous 7 years as a baseline, along with a trading platform, for making the market more effective and ensuring a smaller impact on the reduction target of the polluters."
BenDorToddK.2019AMoE,,Agent-Based Modeling of Environmental Conflict and Cooperation,"BenDor, Todd K. and Scheffran, Jürgen",2019,,,,,,,CRC Press,Milton,"Conflict is a major facet of many environmental challenges of our time. However, growing conflict complexity makes it more difficult to identify win-win strategies for sustainable conflict resolution. Innovative methods are needed to help predict, understand, and resolve conflicts in cooperative ways. Agent-Based Modeling of Environmental Conflict and Cooperation examines computer modeling techniques as an important set of tools for assessing environmental and resource-based conflicts and, ultimately, for finding pathways to conflict resolution and cooperation. This book has two major goals. First, it argues that complexity science can be a unifying framework for professions engaged in conflict studies and resolution, including anthropology, law, management, peace studies, urban planning, and geography. Second, this book presents an innovative framework for approaching conflicts as complex adaptive systems by using many forms of environmental analysis, including system dynamics modeling, agent-based modeling, evolutionary game theory, viability theory, and network analysis. Known as VIABLE ( V alues and I nvestments from A gent- B ased interaction and L earning in E nvironmental systems), this framework allows users to model advanced facets of conflicts—including institution building, coalition formation, adaptive learning, and the potential for future conflict—and conflict resolution based on the long-term viability of the actors’ strategies. Written for scholars, students, practitioners, and policy makers alike, this book offers readers an extensive introduction to environmental conflict research and resolution techniques. As the result of decades of research, the text presents a strong argument for conflict modeling and reviews the most popular and advanced techniques, including system dynamics modeling, agent-based modeling, and participatory modeling methods. This indispensable guide uses NetLogo, a widely used and free modeling software package, to implement the VIABLE modeling approach in three case study applications around the world.

They offer enabling environments for productive human interactions and the growth of knowledge-based industries which drives economic growth through innovation. Both through hard and soft infrastructure, they offer physical connectivity which fosters human creativity and results in higher income levels. When combined with population density, socio-economic diversity and societal tolerance; the elevated interaction intensity diffuses creativity and improves productivity. In many developing country cities however, rapid urbanization is increasing sprawl and causing deteriorating in public services. We operationalize these insights by creating a stylized agent-based model where heterogeneous and independent decision-making agents interact under the following three scenarios: (1) improved urban transportation investments; (2) mixed land-use regulations; and (3) reduced residential segregation. We find that any combination of these scenarios results in greater population density and enables the diffusion of creativity, thus resulting in economic growth. However, the results demonstrate a clear trade-off between rapid economic progress and socioeconomic equity mainly due to the crowding out of low-and middle-income households from clusters of creativity."

This study aims to fill these gaps and develop a tool aiming at more holistic and accurate eWOM management assessment. Design/methodology/approach An agent-based model is developed based on eWOM-related hospitality/business theories and empirical evidence on the NetLogo 6.0.2 platform, wherein a series of simulated experiments are conducted. Findings Simulation patterns suggest that conformity to the majority’s choice of eWOM usage can be beneficial for consumption satisfaction, yet conformity to a group’s eWOM posting choice can compromise satisfaction. Compared to the brief reputation-boosting benefit of exaggerated advertising, honesty in advertising is preferable given its compatibility with competing eWOM distribution and long-term reputation benefits. Practical implications A preliminary tool is developed for hospitality businesses that aids the clearer interpretation of and more accurate/cost-efficient assessment of effectiveness in managing eWOM distribution. Generic directions for improved eWOM management are also provided. Originality/value A prototype model is established that surpasses existing models in its ability to capture the complexity of eWOM management and more accurately assess management effectiveness.

Empty containers accumulated at specific ports cannot only generate profit but also increase the environmental footprint. This research proposes a Maritime Empty Container Reposition Modelling Framework by integrating the agent-based modelling (ABM) paradigm to model the global movements of empty containers. An agent-based maritime logistic empty container redistribution model was developed to help minimize the total relevant costs for empty container movement in the planning horizon. In the system, ports, shipping companies, customers, and empty containers were identified as critical agents. Using simulated annealing (SA), shipping line agents were able to optimise empty container repositioning to determine the best sequence for moving containers. The model was applied to the Asia-Middle East region to simulate global empty containers repositioning in the region. The results comparison shows that the proposed optimised empty container repositioning framework can significantly reduce the shipping line's costs and make full use of empty containers."

It is apparent that there is a growing disparity between the available supply of fish and the desire of the growing world population to catch them. Although studies have begun to question the ecological sustainability of managed fishery systems, they often omit the corresponding effects on the economic sustainability of fishery industries. This is particularly important in rural coastal areas where the fishing industry is often a dominant employer. In this article, we analyze the interactions between economic and ecological dynamic systems using a multi-agent dynamic model of fishery management. Multiple agents (fishers) harvest multiple fish species and adapt the amount and allocation of their effort to their value functions, which are given as net profits of the fish harvest sold for a market price. This is largely unique in fishery models, since many econometric studies view fishers as represented by homogenous ‘average’ agents. We introduce and compare two different decision rules governing the behavior of fishers engaged in a competitive market. We demonstrate a situation where both behaviors lead to a decline of all fish stocks, as well as profits for most fishers. As an alternative, we introduce a cooperative approach in which fisheries jointly set sustainable limits for total harvest and effort that are then distributed to the fishers according to distribution rules. The simulation reveals that fish stocks and profits can stabilize at significantly higher levels in the cooperative case, leading to a continuous accumulation of capital for all fishers. This model demonstrates key aspects of overfishing conflicts that can be overcome through planned fishing quotas and cooperative market mechanisms. It also demonstrates a novel approach for simulating the dynamic behavior of heterogeneous fishers."

Practitioners seek risk analysis methods that quantify risk propagation in the network as realistically and extensively as possible and present the results with sufficiently clear key figures and diagrams. Existing approaches, however, reveal their weaknesses precisely in these areas. While existing Bayesian network approaches only model the results of forward propagative effects through subjectively estimated and assumed conditional probabilities, current Agent-based Models provide insight into the dynamic interactions for specific research purposes, but fail to present the results of propagations concisely and to consider the network in total. This paper highlights the synergy effects of a combination of Agent-based Modeling and Bayesian networks not previously considered in the literature. A risk analysis methodology is presented that captures the complex interrelationships of various risk scenarios in disrupted supply networks. It offers both forward and backward risk propagations and direct and indirect risk consequences in a way that is easily digestible by management. For this purpose, three novel risk metrics for Bayesian networks are presented that quantify the exact risk propagation pattern in the network and provide a more accurate planning basis for mitigation strategies. Our methodology is applied to an excerpt of a supply network in the consumer goods industry and illustrates the approach and its benefits."

Design/methodology/approach This paper describes the construction of an evolutionary game model and a multi-agent-based model of innovative behavior-based decisions by heterogeneous high-tech firms. The models are used to analyze the evolution path and evolutionarily stable strategy of innovative behavior-based decisions. In addition, multi-agent-based simulation is used to gain insight into the effects of competitive dynamics on the dynamic evolution of innovative behavior-based decisions. Findings This paper reveals four evolutionary equilibrium states of the innovation behavior-based decisions of high-tech firms. Based on the findings, these overall evolutionary trends are not affected by the timing of competitive market entry or the intensity of competition. In addition, simulated evidence is added that the timing of competitive market entry is an important factor affecting market-leading innovative strategies and dynamic competition results, and competition intensity is closely related to the evolutionary speed of innovation behavior-based decisions. Originality/value The key contribution of this paper is its new view of innovative behavior-based decisions from a competitive dynamics perspective. The new competitive dynamics-based framework for innovative behavior-based decisions of high-tech firms proposed in the paper can resolve the problem of obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage for high-tech firms in a competitive dynamics context."

Cap-and-trade policy is generally considered an effective instrument in groundwater markets since it can facilitate environmental protection and sustainable groundwater use. While this policy is implemented in several aquifers all over the world, there is a limited understanding of its social impacts, like how compliance and noncompliance behaviors may emerge. This study presents an agent-based groundwater model to evaluate the effects of monitoring and enforcement levels on farmers' social behaviors, namely boldness and vengefulness. The social, economic, and hydrologic impacts of implementing the cap-and-trade policy in the Rafsanjan Plain, located in Iran, are assessed. To this end, the groundwater market model is evaluated under different monitoring and enforcement scenarios. Results show that the efficacy of the cap-and-trade policy in groundwater markets substantially depends on the monitoring level and enforcement power. The appropriate monitoring and enforcement settings can lead to the emergence of a social norm that is enough to discourage violation and can bring about a functioning market in which the farmers can be better off economically, and the annual drawdown can become less severe. Furthermore, water buyback programs can increase market competition, compliance level, and farmers' profits. This study specifically demonstrates that as a result of the implementation of the cap-and-trade policy, social norms emerge that affect the whole system, from farmer agents to the efficacy of the policy. While this study concentrated on the application of the cap-and-trade policy in groundwater management, the results can provide a foundation for specifying frameworks of the cap-and-trade policy for managing other limited resources or greenhouse gasses emission."

For this purpose, an agent-based simulation model of farmers' social interactions and economic interests (ABM) with various support scenarios and random supervision and training by the government agent is developed to evaluate its impact on independent farmers' decision-making in the form of a complex adaptive system. Finally, a fault tree analysis (FTA) is created in the Cara-FaultTree 4.1. software to identify scenarios that lead to the non-development technology in irrigation management (non-DTIM) in the LU sub-basin. The assessment of the impact of government supervision and training revealed that the main causes of non-DTIM in the LU basin are a lack of demands from farmers and low awareness among residents of the basin, with failure probabilities of 0.90 and 0.86, respectively. Ultimately, the failure probability of the main event (non-DTIM) was 0.50. The paths of proper training and farmers' requirements for sustainable agricultural water supply should become more stringent. The results confirm that appropriate measures to strengthen government supervision and training, as well as raise farmers' awareness of the importance of long-term sustainability of water resources, can lead to greater resilience in the DTIM."

Chandra‐PutraHandi2020Aimo,,An integrated model of real estate market responses to coastal flooding,"Chandra‐Putra, Handi and Andrews, Clinton J.",2020,Journal of industrial ecology,24,2,424-435,,,Wiley,HOBOKEN,"Understanding and improving how humans adapt to climate change are priorities in our research community, and coastal settlements are good places to study adaptation. Severe storm events and sea‐level rise are threatening coastal communities with increasing levels of flood damage. Because ownership of coastal assets is distributed among many private and public actors, both individual property owners and public officials must take adaptive actions. This paper introduces an integrated agent‐based and hedonic pricing modeling system to simulate coastal real estate market performance under non‐equilibrium conditions that reflect the effects of storm events. The modeling system, which is used for policy analysis, is calibrated to conditions in two towns in Monmouth County, New Jersey, USA, which were badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The key findings are that (a) coastal real estate markets capitalize flood risk into property values but this discount diminishes rapidly as time passes between storm events, and (b) there is a distinct equity versus efficiency tradeoff in designing public policies to reduce the cost to society of coastal flooding. Stringent regulation of building practices reduces flood damage but drives away poorer home buyers and owners, whereas informational and incentive‐based policies are fairer but less effective. Hands‐off, market‐based retreat from risky areas is socially costly but allows less wealthy people to remain at the shore, albeit in vulnerable situations. Managed retreat should emphasize improved recreational access to coastal amenities while discouraging people from living there."

The interaction between consumers and e-retailers evolves into a collective set of dynamics within a complex system. Agent-based modeling is well suited to stimulate such complex systems. The purpose of this paper is to integrate agent-based model and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to simulate decision behaviors of e-retailers in competitive online markets. Design/methodology/approach An agent-based network model using the TOPSIS driven by actual price data is developed. The authors ran an experimental model to simulate interactions between online consumers and e-retailers and to record simulation data. A nonparametric test is used to conduct data analysis and evaluate the sensibility of parameters. Findings Simulation results showed that different profits could be obtained for various brands under different social network structures. E-retailers could achieve more profits through cross-selling than single-selling; however, the highest profits can be achieved when some adopt cross-selling, whereas others use single-selling. From a game perspective, the equilibrium for price-adjustment frequency can be determined from the simulation data. Thus, price adjustment differences significantly affect e-retailer profit. Originality/value This study provides new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of online markets. This work also indicates how to build an integrated simulation model with an agent-based model and TOPSIS and how to use an integrated simulation model and interpret its results."

In particular, in sectors where the profit margins are more restricted and customer loyalty depends heavily on the prices offered, in fact, understanding consumer reactions to sales promotions and providing them with the right deal at the right time is critical for retailers to survive. In this study, we propose an agent-based model that uses the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) concept to model how customers react to the various promotional offers they receive, and our study involves a seller agent that dynamically learns the appropriate promotion to give these customers on a customer-specific basis. Using empirical research findings in the literature, we developed the BDI part of the model based on the “Big Five-Factor Model”. Apart from this, we used the Q-learning algorithm to train the seller agent. Furthermore, one of our goals in this study is to show that learning-based decision-making agents can be more competitive on the market than rule-based decision-making agents. We therefore added a rule-based agent to the model and compared its efficacy to that of the learning-based decision-making agent. The model was tested in an artificial market through a series of experiments. The experiment results show that the proposed model can be used in actual applications to automate sales promotion decisions."

Market dynamics represented by competitive and cooperative behaviors of the system's main players is one of the uncertainties that influence the availability and affordability of food products. Efficient modeling of these risks can assist decision-makers in simulating and predicting future actions that mitigate the impact that market dynamics have on the provision of food products. This paper suggests an Agent-based model-based framework that simulates the behavior and tracks the economic and environmental performances of the tomato supply system in the State of Qatar. It considers three different scenarios representing the current situation of the market in addition to a competitive and a cooperative trade network. Interactions between trade partners are modeled using two game theoretic approaches counting Cournot competition and Cartel collusion. Based on the research findings, a competitive global market can bring economic benefits to Qatar as an importing nation, but this approach also entails substantial water consumption and results in significant environmental emissions. Conversely, collaboration among exporting countries demonstrates a potential 20% reduction in water usage and a 15% decrease in environmental emissions compared to the competitive scenario, offering enhanced environmental performance albeit at higher economic costs. This study provides a prescriptive analysis that enables policymakers to quantify the trade-offs between economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. These insights are crucial for guiding strategic planning for food supply security and environmental conservation. By understanding the implications of market structure changes, policymakers can navigate potential challenges more effectively and develop targeted policy interventions that enhance the resilience of the food supply system against market volatility and environmental impacts. This analysis supports proactive policy-shaping that aligns with their desired outcomes, ensuring a balanced approach to managing economic benefits and environmental considerations."

What should be the primary objective, reducing or eliminating surplus food production, requires great change within social, cultural and economic structures. The secondary approach of redistributing surplus food to areas of deficit (in terms of socio-economic groups and/or geographic regions) involves a significant logistical burden, and suffers the same issues as with the elimination of waste. The least desirable, but perhaps most practicable approach, is the use of food waste as a feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion (AD). The strategic adoption of AD can therefore be seen as an important step towards mitigating food waste, but the implementation of efficient AD systems on a large (county/region) scale involves significant complexity. The optimal number, size and location of AD plants, and whether they are centralised versus decentralised, may be determined by considering factors such as supply and proximity to feedstock, transport links, emission hazards and social impact. Reaching balanced and objective decisions when faced with such disparate criteria is inevitably very difficult. To address this problem we prototype and evaluate a decision support tool for county-scale AD planning. Our approach is a hybridised Agent Based Model (ABM) with a Multi Objective Optimisation. We capture the spatio-temporal dependencies that exist in the water, energy and food systems associated with energy derived from food waste using Agent Based Modelling (ABM). The use of Interactive Multi Criteria Analysis as visual analytics offers a means to communicate the co-benefits and trade-offs that may emerge, as well as prioritise the AD strategies, based on the prioritization of criteria. Specifically, the method supports exploration of the social, environmental and economic impact of different AD strategies and decisions, linked to current issues, namely AD scale and adoption. The results highlight a trade-off between transport costs and social acceptability for the AD centralised versus decentralised strategies. When low carbon options are weighted higher then slow, steady and aggressive decentralised strategies are the best strategic adoption of AD. Conversely, when Energy production is considered a priority, then aggressive scaling up in a centralised approach is best with slow and steady approaches being further from the ideal. The framework has demonstrated that it permits a space for dialogue and transparent prioritization of AD strategies based on WEF nexus impacts."

To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path."

In particular, the aim is to illustrate major lines of development in agent-based modeling in the field and to highlight the opportunities and limitations of this research approach. The article employs a twofold approach: First, a survey on research efforts employing agent-based simulation models related to domains of managerial science is given which have benefited considerably from this research method. Second, an illustrative study is conducted in the area of management accounting research, a domain which, so far, has rarely seen agent-based modeling efforts. In particular, we introduce an agent-based model that allows to investigate the relation between intra-firm interdependencies, performance measures used in incentive schemes, and accounting accuracy. We compare this model to a study which uses both, a principal-agent model and an empirical analysis. We find that the three approaches come to similar major findings but that they suffer from rather different limitations and also provide different perspectives on the subject. In particular, it becomes obvious that agent-based modeling allows us to capture complex organizational structures and provides insights into the processual features of the system under investigation."

We provide new insights with respect to the determinants of extreme events, such as flash crashes. Finally, we compare the causal chains and the effectiveness of two potential regulatory policies under the same market circumstances, i.e., minimum resting time and financial-transaction taxes, not only with respect to their flash crash prevention power, but also regarding their impact on market participants and market quality, shedding new light on the policy trade-offs."

These limitations include linearity, homogeneity and stationarity. Agents in ABMs are autonomous entities, who interact with each other and with the environment. ABMs provide an inductive or ‘bottom-up’ approach, i.e. individual-level behaviours define system-level components. ABMs have a unique property to capture emergence phenomena that otherwise cannot be predicted by the combination of individual-level interactions. In this tutorial, we discuss the basic concepts and important features of ABMs. We present a case study of an application of a simple ABM to evaluate the cost effectiveness of screening of an infectious disease. We also provide our model, which was developed using an open-source software program, NetLogo. We discuss software, resources, challenges and future research opportunities of ABMs for economic evaluations."

To reveal the complexity behind government intervention decision, we build a bi-layer network diffusion model for the information-disease dynamics that were intervened in and conduct a full space simulation to illustrate the trade-off faced by governments between information disclosing and blocking. The simulation results show that governments prioritize the accuracy of disclosed information over the disclosing speed when there is a high-level medical recognition of the virus and a high public health awareness, while, for the opposite situation, more strict information blocking is preferred. Furthermore, an unaccountable government tends to delay disclosing, a risk-averse government prefers a total blocking, and a low government credibility will discount the effect of information disclosing and aggravate the situation. These findings suggest that information intervention is indispensable for containing the outbreak of infectious disease, but its effectiveness depends on a complicated way on both external social/epidemic factors and the governments' internal preferences and governance capability, for which more thorough investigations are needed in the future."

Our findings also suggest that the trading frequency determined by the optimal tolerance for the deviation from portfolio targets should be derived from a tradeoff between rebalancing benefits and rebalancing costs. In a relatively calm market, the absolute range of 6% to 8% and the complete‐way back rebalancing technique outperforms others. During particular turbulent periods, however, none of the existing rebalancing techniques improves tax‐adjusted profits and risk‐adjusted returns simultaneously."

Design/methodology/approach The various continuous factors affecting labor productivity are simulated using system dynamics (SD). The heterogeneity of different agents involved in the project and their interactions is accounted using agent-based modelling (ABM). The developed ABM and SD models are finally integrated to simulate the value of labor productivity taking account of all the influencing factors. Findings The proposed hybrid simulation tool is implemented in a real project to evaluate its perfomance. The value of labor productivity is simulated by taking account of all the influencing factors. The most appropriate execution strategy is then selected using the developed hybrid SD-ABM approach to improve productivity. It is shown that the number of working groups and their movement patterns affect the severity of the groups’ interferences which will in turn affect the value of labor productivity. Practical implications This research helps project managers to predict and improve the value of labor productivity taking account of all the influencing factors. Originality/value It is believed that the proposed hybrid SD-ABM simulation approach offers a novel and robust tool for modeling labor productivity because the effects of various continuous influencing factors and the interactions between different agents are taken into account through the combination of SD and ABM. Many complex problems faced in construction projects involve interacting elements of a different nature, and the integration of SD with ideas from ABM offers potential to combine the strengths of the two methodologies to solve the problem."

The heterogeneity in expectations can lead to market instability and complicate dynamics of prices, which are driven by endogenous market forces. In this sense, we use Agent-based computational approach and more specifically artificial Stock Market modeling to explore the market dynamics from a behavioral perspective. Our aim is to point out that the investors’ irrationality explains various numbers of financial anomalies, especially the phenomena that traditional financials models have never been able to explain. We built a virtual financial market that contains three types of investors: fundamentalists, non-fundamentalist and loss adverse investors. Therefore, the difficulty of the prediction is due to several features: the complexity, the non-linearity and the dynamism of the financial market system, as well as the investor psychology. The Artificial Neural Networks learning mechanism take on the role of traders, who from their futures return expectations and place orders based on their expectations. The results of intensive analysis indicate that the existence of agents having heterogeneous beliefs and preferences has provided a better understanding of price dynamics in the financial market."

By contrasting the model results with theoretical and empirical insights from actual cities, the validity of modeling the formation of residential diffusion on urban edges based on individual gain-maximizing daily travel and residential relocation is explained. The major contribution of the model is that it offers a new perspective on the bottom-up control of residential diffusion on urban edges, with benefits for productive human interactions at the microscale. Specifically, the model experimentally suggests the existence of a trade-off between increasing human interactions, through the introduction of an open hub attracting diverse activities and promotion of interaction around it, as well as the progression of residential diffusion. The model also suggests that the direction of urbanization is the result of collective action, and sustainable urbanization may be achieved through concerted efforts."

With ABCE the modeler specifies the decision logic of the agents, the order of actions, the goods and their physical transformation (the production and the consumption functions). Then, ABCE automatically handles the actions, such as production and consumption, trade and agent interaction. The result is a program where the source code consists of only economically meaningful commands (e.g. decisions, buy, sell, produce, consume, contract, etc.). ABCE scales on multi-core computers, without the intervention of the modeler. The model can be packaged into a nice web application or run in a Jupyter notebook."

Using an agent-based approach to sequential games, however, poses some issues that result in a few applications of this type. We contribute to this aspect by applying the agent-based approach to a lobbying game involving environmental regulation and firms' choice of abatement. We simulate this game and test the robustness of its game-theoretical prediction against the results obtained. We find that while theoretical predictions are generally consistent with the simulated results, this novel approach highlights a few differences. First, the market converges to a green state for a larger number of cases with respect to theoretical predictions. Second, simulations show that it is possible for this market to converge to a polluting state in the very long run. This result is not envisaged by theoretical predictions. Sensitivity experiments on the main model parameters confirm the robustness of our findings."

Using an agent based implementation of the Hecksher-Ohlin trade model; the paper confirms Samuelson's 2004 result demonstrating that the principle of comparative advantage does not ensure that technological progress in one country benefits its trading partners. It goes on to demonstrate that the presence of increasing returns leads to a situation with multiple equilibria, where free market trading policies can not be relied on to deliver an outcome which is efficient or equitable, with first movers in development enjoying permanent advantage over later developing nations. Finally, the paper examines the impact of relaxation of the Ricardian assumption of capital immobility on the principle of comparative advantage. It finds that the dynamics of factor trade are radically different from the dynamics of trade in goods and that factor mobility converts a regime of comparative advantage into a regime of absolute advantage, thus obviating the reassuring equity results that stem from comparative advantage."

The objective of this study is to develop a spatial model that simulates land-use change under the influence of human land-use choice behavior. This is achieved by integrating the key physical and social drivers of land-use change using Bayesian networks (BNs) coupled with agent-based modeling. The BNAS model, integrated Bayesian network–based agent system, presented in this study uses geographic information systems, ABMs, BNs, and influence diagram principles to model population change on an irregular spatial structure. The model is parameterized with historical data and then used to simulate 20 years of future population and land-use change for the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. The simulation results identify feasible new urban areas for development around the main transportation corridors. The obtained new development areas and the projected population trajectories with the“what-if” scenario capabilities can provide insights into urban planners for better and more informed land-use policy or decision-making processes."

Its final products are of international character and serve the needs and wants of the global citizen. However, many production processes are causing severe damage to the environment and moreover create health hazard for workers and local populations. This research article focuses on the increasing global unequal economic- and ecological exchange, fundamentally embedded in international trade. Resource extraction and labor conditions in the Global South as well as the implications for climate change originating from industry emissions in the North are investigated with an agent-based model. The model serves as a testbed for simulation experiments with evolutionary political economic policies. An international institution is introduced sanctioning the polluting extractivist sector in the Global South as well as the emitting industrial capital good producers in the North with the aim of subsidizing innovation reducing environmental and social impacts. Both regions are modelled as macroeconomic complex adaptive systems where international trade is restricted to a three-sector value chain, originating from mining resources in the South that are traded to capital good producers in the North crafting machinery which is eventually traded to consumer good firms, both in the North and South. The main outcome of the study is that sanctions alone are not effective in countering unequal exchange. They only make a difference in combination with subsidies for innovation activities, which are protecting labor and reducing local pollution in mines as well as reducing carbon-emissions in capital good production."

The price impact of traded volumes is modelled according to the empirically observed squared root impact function. The time series generated by the agents is characterised by statistical properties typical for foreign-exchange rates: low autocorrelation of returns, fat-tailed distribution of returns, aggregated normality, and the price jump scaling law. Furthermore, we introduce and use as a benchmark, the overshoot scaling law, which is an omnipresent feature of liquid markets and relates the expected length of price overshoots to the length of the corresponding directional-change threshold."

Industrial symbiosis networks (ISNs) can survive in the long run if they have high resilience to perturbations that lead to operational uncertainties. The literature highlights that the resilience of ISNs can be enhanced by ensuring high redundancy of IS relationships: accordingly, firms should exchange the same waste with more symbiotic partners. However, the impact of increasing redundancy on economic and environmental performance of IS has not been investigated so far. This paper proposes a theoretical framework to understand the effect of the redundancy strategy on the performance of companies involved in IS. Accordingly, the optimal redundancy strategy refers to an optimal number of partners to (from) which waste producers (users) should send (receive) wastes to maximize the IS performance. An agent-based model is designed to explore the proposed framework and an agent-based simulation is applied to a marble-concrete IS case. The analysis shows that the optimal redundancy strategy is influenced by the combined effect of waste market dynamicity and transaction costs, and is usually different when viewed from an economic versus an environmental perspective. The paper provides a theoretical contribution based upon the integration of operational aspects of IS with the redundancy concept in IS-based businesses. The adopted methodology is innovative as it integrates willingness to cooperate, bargaining power, and inter-company trust development into the business decision-making process. Finally, how to overcome trade-off challenges between environmental and economic performance is discussed from managerial and practical perspectives. •The role of redundancy in industrial symbiosis (IS) businesses is explored.•An agent-based model is designed to study different redundancy strategies.•A case example is investigated to reveal the impact of redundancy on IS businesses.•Economic and environmental benefits related to redundancy strategies are computed.•Optimal redundancy level is different for economic and environmental performance."

The goal is to show that individual utility can depend on other parameters than wealth and risk aversion, that therefore influence equilibrium market prices. This has been done by examining a possible utility function that takes into account individual sensitivity to the criterion and the intrinsic quality of compliance of this parameter. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed utility function, a simulation is made using agentbased approach with NetLogo platform. Upon examination of the impact of these parameters, it becomes clear that compliance to a qualitative characteristic would impact individual utility, supply and demand and result in equilibrium prices. This research highlights the importance of ethical arguments on individual decision making and how markets behave to this."

Using the agent-based macroeconomic model developed by Poledna et al. (Eur Econ Rev, 151:104306, 2023. 10.1016/j.euroecorev.2022.104306, the study explores the detailed labour market outcomes for different groups in Austria’s population and the macroeconomic effects of the migration scenario. The analysis suggests that Austria’s economy and labour market have the potential to be resilient to the simulated migration influx. The results indicate a positive impact on GDP due to increased aggregate consumption and investment. The labour market experiences an increase in the unemployment rates of natives and previous migrants. In some industries, the increase in the unemployment rates is more significant, potentially indicating competition among different groups of migrants. This research provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders in Austria and other countries that may face the challenge of managing large-scale migration in the near future."

Multi-objective land-use allocation and agent-based modeling are two potent tools to explore the potential of landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services. However, in the case of the former, the real-world feasibility of the biophysically optimal land-use configurations remains unclear. Meanwhile, agent-based models are not well-suited to recognize the biophysical potential of landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem services. In this paper, we propose an approach to align multi-objective optimization with agent-based modeling in order to investigate the economic, institutional and social feasibility of biophysically optimal landscapes. It especially allows to contrast biophysically optimized land-use patterns with the option space circumscribed by relevant policy frameworks. We argue that a structured comparison of biophysical optimization with an exploration of the parameter space of an agent-based model can be used to identify the real-world feasibility and the barriers to reaching multifunctional landscapes. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by using it on a virtual landscape, which allows us to detect the importance of various economic, institutional and behavioral factors that facilitate or hamper moving the social-ecological system toward its biophysical potential. Particularly, we demonstrate the essential role of tailored policy instruments. Our approach can be useful in informing land-use policy with respect to its effectiveness and efficiency in achieving multifunctional landscapes."

The Mekong River Basin, one of the largest river basins in Asia, is facing a great challenge to meet escalating water, food, and energy demands due to rapid development. Meanwhile, climate change and dam development intensify the security issues of these water-related resources. These changes have resulted in flow regime variations that may affect local hydroecological conditions (HEC) further influencing the ecosystem and have resulted in potential economic losses (especially agricultural losses caused by natural hazards). This study explores the impacts of dam development and climate change on baseline local HEC and natural hazard risk (NHR) using a coupled agent-based model that simulates interactions between autonomous agents in the whole basin. A cross-system analysis between the impact on baseline HEC and NHR is conducted to inform future policy in this transboundary basin. The impact on baseline HEC is evaluated from the flow regime variation perspective based on the Range of Variability Approach and the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. The impact on NHR depends on variations in the risk of lowest flow and peak flow. The results primarily show that HEC and NHR in the upstream region are more sensitive to precipitation change. The negative impact on baseline HEC by joint dam development and climate change is more significant in the upstream region as well. Under the “hot and dry” climate condition, dam development can potentially mitigate both ecological and economic “loss” in the middle and downstream regions: Central and Southern Laos, the Kratie area, and Mekong Delta, if additional storage can be used in a flexible manner."

This is because it is Cost-efficient and environmental friendly compared to the other modes of transportation. Despite the significant importance, container barge transportation is faced with several challenges and inefficiencies. One of these challenges is the large waiting time of barges in large container seaports which has negatively impacted the reliability of barge transportation. It is due to these challenges that this study seeks to examine the reasons for barge congestion and poor handling to propose possible solutions to these problems. In achieving these objectives, a quantitative methodological approach was adopted for the study in which agent-based modelling was developed to analyze the different scenarios developed in the study. An impact assessment of each of the different scenarios was conducted to identify the most suitable that would address congestion and handling issues around container barging. The study concluded that the presence of sea vessels and the high priority given to these vessels are major causes of barge congestion in large seaports, hence the study recommends dedicated barge berthing spaces at each terminal. Appropriate smaller cranes should also be invested in, to enhance the handling of the barges."

Donna and Kockelman, Kara M. and Hanna, Josiah P.",2016,"Transportation research. Part A, Policy and practice",94,,243-254,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"•Agent-based model simulates fleet of shared, electric, autonomous vehicles (SAEVs).•Vehicle and charging scenarios show tradeoffs between investment and operations.•Each SAEV can replace 3.7–6.8 privately owned vehicles.•Results suggest SAEV operational costs are most sensitive to vehicle capital costs.•SAEV cost-competitiveness to non-electric vehicles hinges on recharging automation. There are natural synergies between shared autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets and electric vehicle (EV) technology, since fleets of AVs resolve the practical limitations of today’s non-autonomous EVs, including traveler range anxiety, access to charging infrastructure, and charging time management. Fleet-managed AVs relieve such concerns, managing range and charging activities based on real-time trip demand and established charging-station locations, as demonstrated in this paper. This work explores the management of a fleet of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) in a regional, discrete-time, agent-based model. The simulation examines the operation of SAEVs under various vehicle range and charging infrastructure scenarios in a gridded city modeled roughly after the densities of Austin, Texas. Results based on 2009 NHTS trip distance and time-of-day distributions indicate that fleet size is sensitive to battery recharge time and vehicle range, with each 80-mile range SAEV replacing 3.7 privately owned vehicles and each 200-mile range SAEV replacing 5.5 privately owned vehicles, under Level II (240-volt AC) charging. With Level III 480-volt DC fast-charging infrastructure in place, these ratios rise to 5.4 vehicles for the 80-mile range SAEV and 6.8 vehicles for the 200-mile range SAEV. SAEVs can serve 96–98% of trip requests with average wait times between 7 and 10minutes per trip. However, due to the need to travel while “empty” for charging and passenger pick-up, SAEV fleets are predicted to generate an additional 7.1–14.0% of travel miles. Financial analysis suggests that the combined cost of charging infrastructure, vehicle capital and maintenance, electricity, insurance, and registration for a fleet of SAEVs ranges from $0.42 to $0.49 per occupied mile traveled, which implies SAEV service can be offered at the equivalent per-mile cost of private vehicle ownership for low-mileage households, and thus be competitive with current manually-driven carsharing services and significantly cheaper than on-demand driver-operated transportation services. When Austin-specific trip patterns (with more concentrated trip origins and destinations) are introduced in a final case study, the simulation predicts a decrease in fleet “empty” vehicle-miles (down to 3–4% of all SAEV travel) and average wait times (ranging from 2 to 4minutes per trip), with each SAEV replacing 5–9 privately owned vehicles."

Findings are connected to the discussion in institutional economics and economic history concerning the importance of institutional developments in long-distance trade for economic growth in medieval Europe, the efficiency of self-enforcing institutions, and the divergence of institutional arrangements in medieval maritime trade.

To deal with such phenomena, social scientists often use reductionism approach where they reduce them to some lower-lever variables and model the relationships among them through a scheme of equations. This approach that is called equation based modeling (EBM) has some basic weaknesses in modeling real complex systems so that assumptions such as unbounded rationality and perfect information are strongly emphasized while adaptability and evolutionary nature of all engaged agents along with network effects go unaddressed. In tackling deficiencies of reductionism, the complex adaptive system (CAS) framework has been proven very influential in the past two decades. In contrast to reductionism, under CAS framework, complex phenomena are studied in an organic manner where their agents are supposed to be both boundedly rational and adaptive. As the most powerful methodology for CAS modeling, agent-based modeling (ABM) has gained a growing popularity among academics and practitioners. ABMs show how agents' simple behavioral rules and their local interactions at micro scale can generate surprisingly complex patterns at macro-scale. Despite a growing number of ABM publications, those researchers unfamiliar with it have to study a number of works to understand (1) why and what of ABM, (2) its differences with EBM (3) its main functionalities in scientific studies and (4) some of its applications in management science. So, this paper's major contribution is to help researchers particularly those unfamiliar with ABM to get insights regarding its philosophy and use and gain a big picture of it."

This research targets SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities. It strengthens resilience in coastal areas by implementing a social force model using a microscopic agent-based model to assess the impact of human behaviour on evacuation performance by introducing evacuation stress levels due to a tsunami triggered in central Chile. Two scenarios with two environments and three crowd sizes are implemented in NetLogo. In Scenario 1, pedestrians walk at a relaxed velocity. In Scenario 2, tsunami evacuation stress is incorporated, resulting in pedestrians walking at a running velocity, taking, on average, four times less time to evacuate. We explored more realistic settings by considering the internal susceptibility of each agent to spread tsunami evacuation stress among other evacuees. Results from Scenario 2 show that internal susceptibility effects almost double the mean evacuation time for 200 agents. Findings suggest a trade-off between realism and the minimization of evacuation time. This research is considered a first step toward including stress in tsunami evacuations for sustainable evacuation planning."

The application of this method is illustrated with an exemplary agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) regarding the early venture growth process. This bibliometric approach invigorates the utilization of ABMS as a viable researchmethodology in process-oriented entrepreneurship research. Design/methodology/approach - In the bibliometric method, a domain corpus composed of scholarly articles is established and systematically analyzed through co-word analysis to discern essential concepts (i.e. agents, objects, and contexts) and their interrelations. The usefulness of the bibliometric method is elucidated by constructing an illustrative ABMS. Findings - The bibliometric method for designing ABMs identifies essential concepts in the entrepreneurship literature and provides contexts in which the concepts are interrelated. The illustrative ABMS based on these concepts and interrelations accurately and consistently reproduces the emergence of power-law distributions in venture outcomes consistent with empirical evidence, implying further merit to bibliometric procedures. Practical implications - The proposed method can be used not only to build simple models with essential concepts, but also to build more complex models that take a large number of concepts and their interrelations into consideration. Originality/value - This study proposes a bibliometric method for designing ABMs. The proposed method extends similar procedures that are limited to thematic or cluster analysis by examining the semantic contexts in which the concepts co-occur. This research suggests that ABMS from bibliographic sources can be built and validated with empirical evidence. Several considerations are provided for the combined utilization of the bibliometric method and ABMS in entrepreneurship."

Beyond innovation and deployment, other objectives, such as domestic job and industry creation, are usually part of these policy mixes. However, little is known about how policy mixes should be designed and interactions between policy instruments considered when governments try to achieve multiple objectives simultaneously. We address these questions using an agent-based model of the sociotechnical system for solar photovoltaics in Germany that simulates technology adoption, industry dynamics, international spillovers and trade. By changing public spending on research and development and the solar feed-in tariff, forty-five variations of the historical policy mix in Germany are systematically evaluated. The results show that a narrow focus on innovation and deployment outcomes by academic researchers can lead to recommendations for the design of policy mixes that compromise key dimensions of sociotechnical change, such as job creation. Moreover, the simulations reveal that, because of path-dependent interactions between policy instruments, minor changes in the design of policy instruments can lead to vastly different policy outcomes. These findings have important implications for the literature on policy mixes, technology-push and demand-pull instruments, and sociotechnical transitions. •Little is known about how to design policy mixes for multiple policy objectives.•What emphasis to place on technology-push and demand-pull is still debated.•We analyze 45 variations of Germany's solar policy mix using an agent-based model.•Interactions between both policies are key for goals beyond innovation & deployment.•Near configuration boundaries, small policy changes bring big sociotechnical change."

As a result, organizations are paying more attentions to supporting business process management with the ability to adapt to the dynamic environment. Furthermore, business climate is changing from centralized and closed to distributed and open mainly by virtue of the proliferation of networks. Therefore, an agent-based approach is proposed in this research to manage complex business activities. In this approach, business activities are delegated to a number of autonomous agents. These agents may be human beings as well as machines or software applications. Each of them has awareness of situation and can make real-time decisions on activities. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

The key focus of this approach is to utilize diversity in load consumption patterns of the customers and energy availability from the distributed energy resources, distributed storage, and demand response (DR) in reducing the peak demand and minimizing the cost of electricity. An index-based incentive mechanism is also proposed to encourage customers participating in DR based on frequency and size of the participation. The proposed strategies are validated using two case studies with interconnected microgrids. Based on extensive simulation results of the system being developed using the Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE), it has been found that multiagent-based energy management with DRaDS is successful in reducing the system peak and cost benefit for customers with a high priority index."

Proceedings,,,1-,,,Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE),Norcross,"The restructured electricity wholesale market encourages competition among the participants so that they might be able to maximize their net earnings via strategic bidding behavior. Along with the increasing penetrations of stochastic renewable generations (e.g., wind power), one critical problem for such participants is how to optimize the bids by integrating with the production uncertainty of renewable energy. This paper investigates this issue for a wind generation company (WGenCo) participating in the day-ahead electricity market based on AMES V2.05, an agent-based simulation package. For three different scenarios of considering the short-term wind forecasts during the bidding process, the agent-based simulations are performed under the uniform price auction rule and locational marginal pricing mechanism. The results demonstrate the economic benefits of combining the wind forecasts and improving the forecasting accuracy. This indicates that, with fluctuating productions, the WGenCo should be more strategic to sell wind power on the wholesale electricity market by combining the prediction variation with its supply offer. The results also demonstrate that agent-based simulation is a good modeling tool which can provide realistic insights for the complex interactions among different participants and various factors.

Part D, Transport and environment",131,,104203-,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"Eco-routing is widely researched as a promising way to reduce traffic-related environmental externalities. Past studies indicate that fuel-sensitive eco-routing trades the fastest routes with shorter, slower urban roads to take advantage of the “optimal fuel economy”. However, past studies focusing on individual routes often fail to depict the spatial redistribution of traffic being closer to the residential areas when eco-routing is adopted at a large scale. This research conducts city-scale fuel-sensitive routing simulations for two large metropolitan areas: the San Francisco Bay Area case and the Tokyo Area case. Combining agent-based simulations with data-driven fuel model, it is revealed that fuel-sensitive routing exerts heavier traffic on the local streets and increases residents’ direct exposure to traffic. Furthermore, by comparing different sub-areas, the varied degrees of traffic redistribution are found to be mainly dependent on the availability of major roads as alternative routes, and existing traffic congestion levels in an area."

Rational antibacterial policy, combined with enforcement of infection control practices are key strategies to combat AMR in the hospital setting. Loss of antibacterial activity as a direct result of antibacterial consumption can be modelled via the economic approach of a negative externality. Objective: To determine the externalities of antibacterial consumption and alcohol-based hand rub use for hand disinfection. Methods: A simple model was built, combining the results of a recently conducted cost-of-illness study with the results of a multivariate time-series analysis, which determined the impact of antibacterial consumption and alcohol-based hand rub use on the incidence of hospital-acquired infections caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Results: Consumption of a single defined daily dose of second-generation cephalosporins, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and lincosamides is associated with a negative externality of about €5, €15, €11 and €12, respectively. In contrast, use of 1 litre of alcohol-based hand rub solution for hand disinfection is associated with a positive externality of about h61. In other words, a single disinfection of the hands (use of 3mL alcohol-based hand rub solution) saves an average €0.18 of the potential cost incurred by MRSA-related infections. Conclusions: Quantifying the externalities of antibacterial use and alcoholbased hand rub use may lead to changes in prescribing behaviour and increase compliance with hand disinfection. Furthermore, the presented methodology of relating the cost of resistance to specific factors such as antibacterial use and hand disinfection provides information that may be useful for prioritizing prevention methods."

It will no longer be satisfactory merely to rely on relatively simple input-output based methodologies to calculate the effects of proposed policy changes because crucial parameters assumed to be fixed in such a framework actually change significantly in rsponse to relative price changes. Secondly, the rapidly changing economic environment in Eastern Europe can also be expected to induce economic agents to assume a different attitude toward decision making. Thus, they may try harder to reduce costs or develop new markets. This means, though, that one cannot expect to explain the effects of the early stages of tansition simply as consequences of exogenous relative price changes. It is essential to allow some of the most important behavior functions in the model to shift."
PfluegerMichael2008Asof,,A synthesis of footloose-entrepreneur new economic geography models: when is agglomeration smooth and easily reversible?,"Pflueger, Michael and Suedekum, Jens",2008,Journal of economic geography,8,1,39-54,,,Oxford University Press,OXFORD,"Models of the new economic geography share a number of common conclusions, but also exhibit notable differences, in particular with respect to the shape of the location pattern. Some models imply a catastrophic agglomeration process with hysteresis, so that concentration in one region is not easily reversible. Other models suggest that agglomeration may be smooth, easily reversible and not necessarily feature extreme 'bang-bang' outcomes. These differences reflect the fact that new economic geography models have relied heavily on specific functional forms. In this article we approach the properties of a particular class of new economic geography models, the class of 'footloose entrepreneur models', with a unifying framework based on the indirect utility function of mobile agents. We are able to provide general, yet handy, formulae to determine the break point and the bifurcation pattern. An application of this framework allows us to show how specific results in the literature can be reconciled as special cases, so that the origin of their differences can be highlighted."

Using a housing data set from three regions of Ghana (collated from real estate agents), the purpose of this paper is to estimate the relative importance of housing attributes to house prices.Design/methodology/approachThe hedonic regression analysis conducted indicates that location is the most powerful determinant of house prices. Other relevant factors are the number of bedrooms, the number of floors, the total floor area, land size, age of the house and luxury finishing.FindingsThe implications of these results are many. Policy wise, the study provides an evidence-based empirical study that supports the need for better urban planning to improve communities, which in turn is associated with house price appreciations. Homeowners, investors and creditors, particularly mortgage lenders could be the immediate beneficiaries. Drawing on this, improved urban planning could mitigate strategic defaults that results from house prices falling below mortgage loan balances. This is important for financial market stability.Originality/valueThe paper provides a comprehensive and unique understanding of the hedonic determinants of house prices in Ghana. Future studies could examine the effect of location upon mortgage lending in Ghana."

The current project is a continuation of the Life Cycle Cost Modeling of High-Speed Commercial Aircraft1 , which is a follow-on to a 2021 study led by Deloitte and SpaceWorks entitled Commercial Hypersonic Transportation Market Study2 . Based in part on the recommendations of these prior studies, the objectives of this current effort were to expand the trade space to include Mach 1.5 aircraft and conduct additional trade studies. These included utilizing tech stops to extend serviceable range between city pairs, mixed aircraft fleets based on market size, flight scheduling to maximize value of the travel opportunity, and scenarios with multiple service operators. Additionally, SpaceWorks conducted new market surveys and research to update air passengers’ willingness-to-pay for highspeed flights given the changes in macroeconomic conditions since the start of the Commercial Hypersonic Transportation Market Study with Deloitte. Ultimately, the new data and capability to evaluate all the trade studies were implemented in a new simulation environment called MIDAS (Multi-market Integrated Dynamic Aerospace Simulation). This sophisticated tool, implemented using AnyLogic software, utilizes agent-based and discrete event simulation (DES) techniques to provide highly detailed analysis and assessment of the high-speed aircraft market problem."
HoKimHinDavid2007Mtso,,Modeling the structure of CV formation and expectations,"Ho, Kim Hin (David)",2007,Journal of property investment & finance,25,2,179-206,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,,"Purpose - The paper aims to form system dynamics modeling in introduced in conjunction with econometric analysis and planned scenario analysis which will uniquely structure the process whereby the ex ante capital values of the prime retail real estate sector.Design methodology approach - The integrated system dynamics model investigates the structural factors affecting a unique expectation-centered capital value (CV) formation of the prime retail real estate sector, through system dynamics modeling, econometric analysis , and the analysis of planned scenarios. This model extends beyond the usual lags and time line aspect of the price discovery process. The retail real estate sector is investigated within the Singapore context, as this sector changes dynamically and non-linearly in relation to rental, cost and general demand expectations and to exogenous shocks like the Severe Advanced Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. These macroeconomic factors are introduced to investigate their impact on retail space CVs through sensitivity analysis, during the simulation period of 20 quarters from the zero reference quarter (2Q2002).Findings - The paper finds that simulation runs of the expectations-centered system dynamics model are based on three scenarios. Sensitivity analysis is conducted for each scenario. Optimistic scenarios' CVs are lower than those of the likely scenario, owing to developers forming excessively high expectations that cannot be met by the actual rental levels. Pessimistic scenarios' CVs are highest. Based on bounded logic and the conditions for all scenarios, there are huge differences in expectations resulting in a large disparity in the endogenous CVs. Low actual rents are primarily due to poor informational efficiency, as the prime retail real estate sector is not transparent enough, and that many transactions are privately closed. Expectations cannot be met as the market information is not disseminated extensively through the agents and players. The scenarios clearly highlight the problem of informational non-availability in the sector. The main policy implication is a need for a more transparent system of sharing rental and pricing information for the retail real estate sector, which is meaningful for real estate developers, investors and urban planners to sustain the retail real estate sector's viability.Originality value - This paper takes system dynamics modeling to the next level of incorporating econometric analysis, to estimate the sensitivity of retail rent to cost and the change in retail rent, for effectively structuring the dynamic process whereby the ex ante CVs of the prime retail sector in Singapore are formed and assessed, through a unique and rigorous expectations-centered system dynamics model of rents, cost, retail stock, general demand and exogenous factors."
BattenDF2001Clos,,Complex landscapes of spatial interaction,"Batten, DF",2001,The Annals of regional science,35,1,81-111,,,Springer Nature,NEW YORK,"How complex is the spatial economy? Some apostles of complexity argue that complex behaviour can arise in any system consisting of a largish number of intelligent, adaptive agents interacting on the basis of local information only. This paper examines several features of such dynamic systems, including path-dependence, emergence and self-organization. It goes on to explore their importance for the spatial sciences, Because space scales can change abruptly from local to global, strongly-interactive spatial economies sometimes exhibit astonishing collective properties, emergent features which are lawful in their own right. Segregation, self-similarity and the rank-size rule are familiar examples. To understand how collective order arises from seemingly random fluctuations, we must note how agents choose to interact with other agents and with their environment. We must synthesize rather than analyse. In the paper, self-organization is explored in a variety of contexts, including Schelling's model of neighborhood segregation and some work with cellular automata that has sharpened our insights into the collective synthesis of agents' interactions. Power laws are widely observed. A new way of doing social science - agent-based simulation - offers powerful new insights. It seems likely to revolutionize our field, along with the whole of the social sciences. Some of the current research underway in this area is discussed."

Mostafa and Pahlevan Sharif, Saeed",2020,Journal of hospitality and tourism technology,11,3,425-445,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the relationships between service quality, perceived value and hotel guest satisfaction, drawing upon data from TripAdvisor – an online travel agent (OTA) platform. The study also investigates the mediating role of perceived value on the relationship between service quality and satisfaction, as well as the moderating role of hotel star ratings on all direct and indirect relationships. Design/methodology/approach Data for this study were collected via Web scraping from August–October 2018. Data were collected from 192 three- to five star-rated hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Partial least squares – structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Furthermore, importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) was performed to identify the most important items of service quality and perceived value in improving customer satisfaction. Findings The findings of this study provide support for all direct and indirect relationships for three-star and four- and five-star hotels. Moreover, the results indicate that perceived value mediates the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction. These results support the moderating role of hotel star ratings for the relationship between service quality and perceived value. The results also show that after perceived value, three-star hotels looking to improve customer satisfaction should prioritize improving the quality of their services, sleep quality, cleanliness and rooms. Four- and five-star hotels, on the other hand, should prioritize service, cleanliness, room and sleep quality. Originality/value OTA platforms collect a wealth of data pertaining to large number of hotels; nevertheless, few studies to date have drawn on this data to examine a pre-determined conceptual framework developed based on the literature. As such, this study makes a valuable methodological contribution to the tourism and hospitality literature. In terms of theoretical contributions, this study examines the mediating role of perceived value between service quality and satisfaction using OTA data. In addition, this study assesses the moderating role of hotel star ratings for the direct and indirect effects of service quality on satisfaction. Using IPMA, this study compares the importance and performance of service quality indicators to generate satisfaction between three-star and four- and five-star hotels. 论使用OTA以指出酒店顾客满意度的因子 研究目的 本论文检测了服务质量、价值感知、和酒店顾客满意度之间的关系, 使用TripAdvisor的数据—OTA。本论文还检测了价值感知对服务质量和满意度之间的中介作用, 以及酒店星级评价对其中直接和间接关系的调节作用。. 研究设计/方法/途径 本论文采样通过网络爬虫技术, 截取了2018年八月至十月之间的数据。研究样本为192家马来西亚Kuala Lumpur地区的三星-五星酒店。样本分析方法为PLS-SEM。此外, 本论文采样IPMA分析法来找出提高顾客满意度中的服务质量和价值感知中最重要的因子。. 研究结果 研究结果指出了三星、四星、五星酒店的直接和间接关系。此外, 研究还显示了服务质量和顾客满意度关系的价值感知中介作用。研究结果还指出了酒店星级评价对服务质量和价值感知关系的调节作用。此外, 研究还指出, 除了价值感知, 如果三星酒店想提高顾客满意度, 那么他们应该优先提高其服务质量、睡眠质量、清洁度、和房间。另一方面, 四星和五星酒店应该优先提高其服务质量、清洁度、房间、和睡眠质量。. 研究原创性/价值 OTA平台搜集大量酒店数据, 但是很少作品研究这些数据, 以检测根据文献提出的理论模型。因此, 本论文在方法论上对旅游酒店文献做出宝贵贡献。理论贡献而言, 本论文使用OTA数据检测了价值感知对服务质量和满意度关系之间的中介作用。此外, 本论文检测了酒店星级评价对服务质量和满意度之间直接和间接关系的调节作用。本论文使用IPMA方法, 比较各种服务质量指标的重要性对在三星、四星、五星酒店的提高满意度的不同作用。."

Design/methodology/approach Empirical testing of this model by investigating personnel across Taiwan’s and Indonesia’s banks confirms the applicability of stress theory in cross-cultural business management. Of the 161 Chinese-language questionnaires distributed to the employees from the three large banks in Taiwan, 137 usable questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 85 percent. At the same time, of the 234 Indonesian-language questionnaires distributed to the employees from the two large banks in Indonesia, 219 usable questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 93.6 percent. Findings This research reveals that mental disengagement fully mediates the indirect relationship between performance-related anxiety and turnover intention, while positive reinterpretation fully mediates the indirect relationship between work pressure and turnover intention. Furthermore, the effects of performance-related anxiety and work pressure on turnover intention are moderated by cross-country differences. Originality/value First, the finding concerning the full mediating role of mental disengagement complements prior justifications of the conservation of resources theory. Second, the finding of this study regarding the full mediating role of positive reinterpretation complements the previous findings of Taylor’s (1983) theory of cognitive adaptation, which conceptualizes employees as active agents in restoring the psychological equilibrium in the aftermath of a competitive pressurized event."
SchaferDonWallace2014Acff,,A conceptual framework for resilience engineering in construction safety,"Schafer, Don Wallace",2014,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Poor safety performance is a chronic problem that plagues the U.S. construction industry. Some researchers contend that accidents are the result of disruptions. Disruptions are those happenings that interrupt, or disturb, the normal course of work. The overarching goal of this study is to explore schemes and methods to understand, harness, and foresee disturbances that arise from demands placed on the construction operations of project-based organizations that deliver the built environment. This study examines the emerging paradigm of Resilience Engineering (RE) as a means to avoid, mitigate, and recover from disruptions, considering these as the bell weather of untoward happenings on construction projects that endanger worker safety. The ways that RE differs from traditional thinking about dealing with disruptions, the current principles and practices of RE, elements of RE useful to construction projects, and simulation of RE were critical elements addressed in this work. RE is an emerging discipline that has been described as a paradigm shift about safety. The RE approach recognizes the need for a progressive safety plan that is systems-based, sociotechnical in its outlook, views work as a complex activity, and is concurrently reactive and proactive in its vigilance to prevent accidents. In the RE outlook safety is a core value of the organization. RE looks for ways to balance the tensions among ongoing production and economic pressures and safety, recognizing the need to pull back or stifle production when safety is threatened. A basic premise of RE maintains that adjustments are needed in systems given that performance conditions are always underspecified. To be considered resilient, a system must possess the abilities of anticipation, monitoring, response, and learning. This work includes an extensive literature review, development of a framework that describes how RE might be deployed in a construction setting, and a hybrid computer simulation employing agent-based and discrete event modeling that demonstrates the RE principle of the Efficiency-Thoroughness Trade-Off (ETTO). The literature review revealed that RE has a rich history that is solidly built upon and expands previous approaches to system disruption in general and safety management in particular. The framework developed utilized the literature review and focused on translating RE premises and principles to the construction industry. The main thesis of the work posits that the key features needed for construction companies to act resiliently are for executives to consider resilience as a quality of the system, to consider RE as a definitive positional strategy, to develop a ""just"" culture to support RE implementation, and to view construction systems functionally as opposed to structurally. Additionally, the framework offers guidance and instruction with regard to the essential abilities of anticipation, monitoring, response, and learning. Finally, the hybrid computer simulation proved to be a worthy exemplar of the possibility for agents with resilient behaviors to populate and act in a simulated discrete-event production setting beset with disruptions. Given that RE is an emerging paradigm, hybrid computer simulation may provide a useful tool for researchers to scaffold as this concept is carried forward."
HeinerRonaldA.1985OoPB,,Origin of Predictable Behavior: Further Modeling and Applications,"Heiner, Ronald A.",1985,The American economic review,75,2,391-396,,,The American Economic Association,NASHVILLE,"Economic theory is based on the assumption that agents act ''as if'' they are able to maximize according to well-behaved preferences, regardless of the complexity of their decision problems. Economic theory thus has never analyzed the consequences of a genuine gap between an agent's decision-making competence and the difficulty of a decision problem (called the C-D gap). In a recent paper (Heiner, 1983), a general theory for investigating the latter possibility was presented. A major theme of the argument was that recurrent pattern in behavior stems from decision-making uncertainty due to a C-D gap, so that uncertainty becomes the basic source of predictable behavior. In an extension of that paper, several theory topics are further developed, including: 1. the reliability condition, 2. conventional choice theory as a special case, 3. the relationship between uncertainty and predictable behavior, 4. decomposing reliability into 2 major stages, and 5. the information-complexity trade-off. Some applications of this trade-off are outlined, first for biology applications and then human applications."

The purpose of this paper is to identify what affects users’ intention to reuse and whether they perceive any difference between the two. Design/methodology/approachA conceptual model was developed based on computer-mediated communication (CMC) and interpersonal communication theories. Data were collected online from four different continents (North America, Europe, Asia and Australia). Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to examine the research model. FindingsThe findings mainly reveal that media richness and social presence positively influence trust and reuse intention through task attraction and social attraction; IM users reported significantly higher scores in terms of communication experience, perceived attractiveness of the conversational agent, and trust than chatbot users; users’ trust in the conversational agents is mainly determined by perceived task attraction. Research limitations/implicationsCustomers’ evaluation of the communication environment is positively related to their perceived competence of the conversational agent which ultimately affect their intention to reuse chatbot/IM. The findings reveal determinants of chatbot/IM adoption which have rarely been mentioned by previous work. Practical implicationsPractitioners should note that consumers in general still prefer to interact with human conversational agents. Practitioners should contemplate how to combine chatbot and human resources effectively to deliver the best customer service. Originality/valueThis study goes beyond the Computer as Social Actor paradigm and Technology Acceptance Model to understand chatbot and IM adoption. It is among one of the first studies that compare chatbot and IM use experience in the tourism and hospitality literature."

The need for integrated assessment of the relationship between energy, economy, environment, and society is clear, and this handbook offers an in-depth review of all four pillars of the energy-economy-environment-society nexus. Bringing together contributions from all over the world, this handbook includes sections devoted to each of the four pillars. Moreover, as the financialization of commodity markets has made risk analysis more complicated and intriguing, the sections also cover energy commodity markets and their links to other financial and non-financial markets. In addition, econometric modeling and the forecasting of energy needs, as well as energy prices and volatilities, are also explored. Each part emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of the energy economics field and from this perspective, chapters offer a review of models and methods used in the literature. The Routledge Handbook of Energy Economics will be of great interest to all those studying and researching in the area of energy economics. It offers guideline suggestions for policy makers as well as for future research."

As economic activity becomes mainly intellectual and requires the integration of specific and idiosyncratic skills, firms need to allocate skills to tasks and traditional hierarchical control results increasingly ineffective. In this work, we explore under what circumstances networks of agents, which bear specific skills, may self-organize in order to complete tasks. We use a computer simulation approach and investigate how local interaction of agents, endowed with skills and individual decision-making rules, may produce aggregate network structure able to perform tasks. To design algorithms that mimic individual decision-making, we borrow from computer science literature and, in particular, from studies addressing protocols that produce cooperation in Peer-to-Peer networks. We found that self-organization depends on the structural features of, formal or informal, organizational networks embedding both professionals, holding skills, and project managers, holding access to jobs."

This is achieved by modeling the terminals and their corresponding receivers at the base station as economic and rational agents that engage in a noncooperative game. In the proposed game, each one trades off its available resources (transmit power and detection strategy) so as to selfishly maximize its own revenue (in terms of probability of correct detection) while saving as much energy as possible and satisfying quality-of-service requirements given in terms of probability of false alarm and timing estimation accuracy. The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the game are studied. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition on the system parameters is given for the equilibrium to exist. An iterative and distributed algorithm based on best-response dynamics (at the transmit side) and a practical parameter estimation (at the receive side) are proposed to achieve the equilibrium point. Numerical results are used to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed solution and to make comparisons with existing alternatives in terms of power consumption, synchronization time, and estimation accuracy."

In our modeling approach, all agents are assumed to assign a personal threshold value to a (standardized) house and update the threshold value permanently by a continuous-time filtering procedure based on observing the quoted house prices and the resulting price movements. The traders then trade according to a threshold price strategy (try to sell if the personal threshold value is lower, try to buy if the personal threshold value is higher than the actually quoted house price). Our modeling approach and its resulting characteristics are illustrated via numerical examples that highlight certain realistic constellations between various traders."

The five central conclusions of that review together with a consideration of more recent initiatives form the basis for this critical review. The current state of nexus research, and in particular modeling research, is examined and updated to reflect recent advances, correct some misperceptions, and put the nexus enterprise into the context of larger epistemological issues. The main conclusions of this review are: The considerable and growing diversity in nexus studies necessarily precludes a one‐size‐fits‐all approach, and indeed it has never been an objective to develop a “grand unified nexus theory or model.” A lack of “fundamental equations” between many nexus parameters hinders full quantification of all nexus linkages, though data‐driven, stochastic, and agent‐based approaches offer useful avenues for further development. The use of qualitative and social science methods in nexus studies is rapidly gaining traction, especially when blended with quantitative modeling. Great progress has been made in attempting to break disciplinary siloes, especially when considering integrated assessment models and system dynamics models. The paper concludes with some reflections on how progress to date could inform new initiatives, such as the Sustainable Urban Nexus Project, and future work more generally. These reflections are summarized as follows: Integration of ecosystem services and their relationships to the nexus should be a priority in near‐future nexus research efforts. Social science techniques blended with quantitative modeling efforts, and local stakeholder engagement, are critical to the success and impact of nexus studies and their recommendations. Policy‐relevant recommendations are starting to be developed. Greater focus, and stakeholder involvement, will further the policy impact of nexus studies."
TianYe2015Otda,,On the design and numerical analysis of tradable mobility credit strategies,"Tian, Ye",2015,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Traffic congestion has been placing an extremely high burden on the development of modern cities. Congestion can be alleviated by either increasing road capacity, or by reducing traffic demand. Controlling and managing traffic demand has in turn been viewed as a cost-effective alternative to increasing road capacity, as has been demonstrated many successful applications all around the world. Within the concept framework of Traffic Demand Management (TDM), Active Transportation and Demand Management (ATDM) is the dynamic management, control, and influence of traffic demand and traffic flow of transportation facilities. ATDM strategies attempt to influence traveler behavior and further manage traffic flow in a time-dependent manner within the existing infrastructure Successful ATDM applications include congestion pricing, adaptive ramp metering, dynamic speed limits, dynamic lane use control, etc. Singapore stands out to be an excellent success story of ATDM, as the implementations of “Cap and Trade” license plates and electronic road pricing make motoring a high cost privilege for citizens of Singapore, making the public relies on transit. Monetary leverage is an effective instrument to facilitate ATDM. Examples of ATDM applications adopting monetary instrument includes dynamic congestion pricing, “Cap and Trade” of car licenses, etc. Taking congestion pricing as an example, policy makers are inducing travelers' behavior and alternating their preferences towards different behavior decisions by levying price tags to different choices. As an important underpinning of rationing choice theory, an individual assigns an ordinal number over the available actions and this ordinal number is calculated by their utility function or payoff function. The individual's preference is expressed as the relationship between those ordinal assignments. In the implementation of congestion pricing, policy makers are imposing an additional high disutility to congested roads and therefore pushing some of the travelers to take alternative routes or shift to alternative departure times or even cancel the trips. However, congestion pricing suffers from public aversion as it creates burden on the motoring of low-income people and therefore doesn't help to alleviate social inequality. The concept of Tradable Mobility Credit (TMC) has been proposed by a group of researchers as another innovative application to facilitate dynamic traffic demand management and solve social inequality issues using pricing instruments. The concept of TMC is borrowed from carbon trading in environmental control. A limited quota of personal auto usage is issued to eligible travelers and credits can be traded in a free market fashion. This guarantees that the roadway usage does not exceed capacity while avoiding the negative effects of shortages normally associated with quotation systems. TMC is literally not a market-ready policy as the integration of the supporting infrastructures, including the trading market, the credit assignment component, and the credit charging component, has not been fully explored yet. Existing TMC research focuses on explaining and exploring the equilibrium condition through analytical methods such as mathematical modeling. Analytical models produce perfect convergence curves and deterministic equilibrium traffic flow patterns. Analytical models provide influential guidance for further works but the solution procedure may encounter problems when dealing with larger real world networks and scenarios. Meantime, current analytical models don't consider the microstructure of the credit trading market sufficiently while it's actually the most unique component of TMC system. Motivated by those concerns, an integrated TMC evaluation platform consisting of a policy making module and traveler behavior modules are proposed in this research. The concept of Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) is extensively adopted in this integrated platform as each individual traveler carries his/her personal memory across iterations. The goal of establishing this framework is to better predict a traveler's route choice and trading behavior if TMC is imposed and further provide intelligence to potential policy makers' decision making process. In order to calibrate the proposed integrated platform, an online interactive experiment is designed based on an experimental economic package and a human research element with 22 participants has been conducted on this experiment platform to gather field data regarding a real person's route choice behavior and credit trading behavior in an artificial TMC system. Participants are recruited from forum, listserve, social media, etc. The calibrated platform is proved to have the ability to predict travelers' behavior accurately. A prototype market microstructure is proposed in this research as well and it is proved to be a cost-effective setting and resulted to a vast amount of economic saving given the fact that travelers would behave similar to the prediction generated by traveler behavior module. It's also demonstrated that the principle of Pareto-improving is not achieved in the proposed ABMS models. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)"

The latter potentially offer helpful decision-support tools for operations and production managers.Design methodology approach - A mechanical engineering firm was used as a case study where a combined qualitative and quantitative methodological approach was employed to extract the required data from four senior managers. Company performance measures as well as firm technologies, practices and policies, and their relation and interaction with one another, were elicited. The data were subjected to an evolutionary complex systems (ECS) model resulting in a series of simulations.Findings - The findings highlighted the effects of the diversity in management decision making on the firm's evolutionary trajectory. The CEO appeared to have the most balanced view of the firm, closely followed by the marketing and research and development managers. The manufacturing manager's responses led to the most extreme evolutionary trajectory where the integrity of the entire firm came into question particularly when considering how employees were utilised.Research limitations implications - By drawing directly from the opinions and views of managers, rather than from logical ""if-then"" rules and averaged mathematical representations of agents that characterise agent-based and other self-organisational models, this work builds on previous applications by capturing a micro-level description of diversity that has been problematical both in theory and application.Practical implications - This approach can be used as a decision-support tool for operations and other managers providing a forum with which to explore: the strengths, weaknesses and consequences of different decision-making capacities within the firm; the introduction of new manufacturing technologies, practices and policies; and the different evolutionary trajectories that a firm can take.Originality value - With the inclusion of ""micro-diversity"", ECS modelling moves beyond the self-organisational models that populate the literature but has not as yet produced a great many practical simulation results. This work is a step in that direction."

They can be described at a great variety of scales, from individuals and organisations to countries. Our understanding, often partial, of these entities, and in many cases this understanding is represented in theories and associated mathematical models. In this book, the main examples are models that represent elements of the global system covering such topics as trade, migration, security and development aid together with examples at finer scales. This provides an effective toolkit that can not only be applied to global systems, but more widely in the modelling of complex systems. All complex systems involve nonlinearities involving path dependence and the possibility of phase changes and this makes the mathematical aspects particularly interesting. It is through these mechanisms that new structures can be seen to ‘emerge’, and hence the current notion of ‘emergent behaviour’. The range of models demonstrated include account-based models and biproportional fitting, structural dynamics, space-time statistical analysis, real-time response models, Lotka-Volterra models representing ‘war’, agent-based models, epidemiology and reaction-diffusion approaches, game theory, network models and finally, integrated models. Geo-mathematical modelling:Presents mathematical models with spatial dimensions.Provides representations of path dependence and phase changes.Illustrates complexity science using models of trade, migration, security and development aid.Demonstrates how generic models from the complexity science tool kit can each be applied in a variety of situations This book is for practitioners and researchers in applied mathematics, geography, economics, and interdisciplinary fields such as regional science and complexity science.

An agent auctions a large basket of transactions in several stocks to brokers who do not know the individual stock names, but only some generic characteristics of the basket. The client delivers this large amount of sales and purchases to the winning broker who has to simultaneously trade the basket for a fixed commission fee. The commission is paid on the basis of the winning bid at the auction, usually submitted as cents per share. This study provides a new model, based on large deviations (LD) approximation results, that may facilitate brokers to formulate their bids. A numerical example is used to illustrate the methodology and the model is being compared with a Monte Carlo approximation."

Economic agents in electronic markets generally consider reputation to be a significant factor in selecting trading partners. Most traditional online businesses publish reputation profile for traders that reflect average of the ratings received in previous transactions. Because of the importance of these ratings, there is an incentive for traders to partake in strategic behavior (for example shilling) to artificially inflate their rating. It is therefore important for an online business to be able to provide a robust estimate of a trader’s reputation that is not easily affected by strategic behavior or noisy ratings. This paper proposes such an adaptive ratings-based reputation model. The model is based on a trader’s transaction history, witness testimony, and other weighting factors. Learning is integrated to make the ratings model adaptive and robust in a dynamic environment. To validate the proposed model and to demonstrate the significance of its constructs, a multi-agent system is built to simulate the interactions among buyers and sellers in an electronic marketplace. The performance of the proposed model is compared to that of the reputation model used in most online marketplaces like Amazon, and to Huynh’s model proposed in the literature."

Symbiotic groups are those in which agents complement each other in resources that they have in excess. Symbiotic groups are useful especially when the resources in an environment are distributed unevenly, because they enable agents to trade resources easily. However, for trading to happen successfully, agents in symbiotic groups need to cooperate, i.e., they should be willing to donate resources when appropriate. Similarly, if some agents in a symbiotic group are defectors, they should be identified by others and eliminated from the group for the well-being of the remaining agents. Accordingly, we first study Edmonds’ tag-based model of symbiotic groups to understand the lifespan of symbiotic groups (e.g., why some groups live shorter than others). Then, we enhance Edmonds’ model by adding the capability of reciprocal interactions to agents, thus achieving a hybrid model. We capture reciprocity in three different models and study their effects on the elimination of defectors in symbiotic groups. Our experimental results show that the groups that are built with the proposed hybrid model can eliminate more defectors and earlier than tag-based models. Further, the hybrid approach can generate symbiotic groups more effectively and efficiently."

A review,"Gao, Xiaopeng and Hoffland, Ellis and Stomph, TjeerdJan and Grant, Cynthia A and Zou, Chunqin and Zhang, Fusuo",2012,Agronomy for sustainable development,32,2,465-478,,,Springer-Verlag,Paris,"Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a widely occurring constraint for rice production and for human nutrition. Scarcity of water is leading to a shift from flooded to aerobic rice production, which can have an impact on Zn deficiency in rice. Zinc bioavailability is a function of both soil and plant factors that can be altered by water management, particularly in relation to conditions in the rhizosphere. Biogeochemical modeling based on bulk soil conditions failed to predict the effect of water management on Zn bioavailability, but revealed that dissolved organic anions, pH, and redox conditions were major determinants. Rhizosphere sampling is needed to understand the difference in Zn mobilization and uptake between flooded and aerobic cultivation systems. Zinc bioavailability is not only affected by changes in the chemical properties of the soils, but also by biological processes such as mycorrhizal inoculation and root release of organic compounds into rhizosphere. Phytosiderophores and organic acids are two classes of Zn chelators secreted from roots that have been linked to the release of Zn from soil-bound forms and its subsequent uptake by plants. A shift to aerobic condition provides a favorable environment for activity of mycorrhizal fungi and enhanced mycorrhizal inoculation under aerobic conditions has been shown to increase plant Zn uptake. Aerobic rice genotypes with varying tolerance to Zn deficiency display a trade-off between mycorrhizal Zn responsiveness and root exudation of Zn chelator in the rhizosphere, which is probably due to a competition for carbon. Potential agronomic management practices in aerobic rice production systems are discussed, with an emphasis on their roles in improving bioavailability of Zn. Addition of Zn fertilizers by soil or foliar application have been shown to increase Zn concentration in cereal grains but the extent of the increase differs among crop species. The shift from flooded to aerobic condition can cause significant N transformations, which may consequently affect Zn mobilization and uptake. An appropriate N management strategy, including an effective combination of source, rate, application method, and timing, should consider the effects on soil pH. Application of P fertilizer should be done with careful consideration to the effect on Zn uptake. A reasonable cropping system (intercropping and crop rotation) could prevent Zn deficiency and offer an effective and sustainable pathway to Zn biofortification. Keeping these points in mind, this review describes our current knowledge of Zn bioavailability as affected by changes in soil–plant interactions caused by the transition from flooded to aerobic rice cultivation."

Specifically, the present study examined how and why proactive personality, dispositional resistance to change, and change self-efficacy influence employees’ perceived fairness about the organizational change. Design/methodology/approach – Structural equation modeling was utilized to analyze the survey data obtained from a sample of 140 food service employees after some organizational changes in leadership, menu offerings, and facilities. Findings – The results revealed support for two micromediational chains predicting change fairness: first, change self-efficacy leads to less uncertainty and second, dispositional resistance to change leads to less communication regarding change resulting in employees perceiving they have fewer opportunities to voice concerns about the changes. Research limitations/implications – The cross-sectional design prevents causal inferences and the generalizability of the present findings beyond similar samples experiencing similar changes is unknown. However, the predictions were based on theories that apply to all employees regardless of the changes or the employees’ occupations or workplace. Social implications – Employees with particular personality traits are more receptive to change, suggesting that organizations should consider the impact of individual differences when facing large-scale change. To ensure the success of organizational change, organizations should communicate with employees and encourage employee input before implementing change which in turn improves the chances that employees will have favorable reactions to the change. Originality/value – This is the first study to examine how and why individual difference variables influence employees’ perceptions about organizational change fairness."

Hence, the sustainability performance tends to become a strategic goal that FVs’ operators and decision makers (e.g., transport agents, warehouse providers and freight forwarders, logistics operators, and FV management company) endeavor to achieve. However, due to the lack of a systematic approach toward FVs sustainable development, existing literature has not yet clearly defined what strategic direction should be followed to pursue such a goal. This article proposes a knowledge-related approach to promote sustainability performance of FVs. This article highlights sustainability as a strategic goal of FVs rooting in the evidences from academia and practical cases. In addition, it explains the principle of ensuring sustainability by FVs with twofold meanings. Meanwhile, it summarizes the sustainability dimensions in the context of FVs. After introducing the significances of knowledge assets and knowledge management (KM) approach to the sustainability drawing on the implications from sustainability balanced scorecard (SBSC), it analyses KM characteristics in logistics and FVs area. Then, how the general KM process (knowledge acquisition, sharing, and application) act on FVs sustainable development is clarified. In which, the sustainability-related stakeholders of FVs are identified. Finally, it proposes a roadmap of organizing KM for sustainability-oriented FVs considering the distinct features of KM in FVs context. To support the success of this roadmap, this article recognizes two key elements including human ability and stakeholders’ involvement. Furthermore, a checklist for building FVs sustainability capability based on SBSC is provided, which is hopefully being a referring guidance for FVs’ operators and decision makers."

Unfortunately, social-ecological systems (SES) theory, sustainability evaluation frameworks, and assessment methods are still foreign not only to farmers but to many researchers, students, NGOs, policy makers/operators, and other interested groups. In this paper we examine the main achievements and challenges of the MESMIS Program (Spanish acronym for Indicator-based Sustainability Assessment Framework), a 15-year ongoing effort with impact in 60 case studies and 20 undergraduate and graduate programs mainly in Ibero-America that is attempting to cope with the stated challenges. The MESMIS experience shows that it is possible to conduct sustainability assessments in the context of small farmers through a long-term, participatory, interdisciplinary, and multi-institutional approach that integrates a solid theoretical background, a field-tested operational framework, learning tools specifically devised to facilitate the understanding of sustainability as a multidimensional and dynamic concept, and a growing set of case studies to apply to and get feedback from users. Specifically, through the dissemination of the MESMIS assessment framework in a large set of case studies in a contrasting set of social-ecological contexts, we have been able to: (a) characterize the NRMS, their subsystems, and their main interactions; (b) link attributes, i.e., general systemic properties, with sustainability indicators to assess critical socioeconomic and environmental aspects of the NRMS; (c) integrate indicators through multicriteria tools and to expose the multidimensional aspects of sustainability; (d) propose an initial multiscale assessment to articulate processes and actors at different spatial scales; (e) develop multimedia learning tools, i.e., Interactive-MESMIS, to help users understand dynamic concepts, trade-offs, and counter-intuitive behavior; and (f) promote participatory processes through role-playing games and agent-based simulation models. Key challenges are related to the need to conduct long-term longitudinal studies that fully capture system dynamic properties while at the same time actively involving relevant stakeholders through creative and lasting participative processes. We outline an improved assessment framework that should help move the program in this direction."
BurrellNoah2023MIiP,,Measurement Integrity in Peer Prediction: A Peer Assessment Case Study,"Burrell, Noah and Schoenebeck, Grant",2023,,,,369-389,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA","We propose measurement integrity, a property related to ex post reward fairness, as a novel desideratum for peer prediction mechanisms in many natural applications. Like robustness against strategic reporting, the property that has been the primary focus of the peer prediction literature, measurement integrity is an important consideration for understanding the practical performance of peer prediction mechanisms. We perform computational experiments, both with an agent-based model and with real data, to empirically evaluate peer prediction mechanisms according to both of these important properties. Our evaluations simulate the application of peer prediction mechanisms to peer assessment---a setting in which ex post fairness concerns are particularly salient. We find that peer prediction mechanisms, as proposed in the literature, largely fail to demonstrate significant measurement integrity in our experiments. We also find that theoretical properties concerning robustness against strategic reporting are somewhat noisy predictors of empirical performance. Further, there is an apparent trade-off between our two dimensions of analysis. The best-performing mechanisms in terms of measurement integrity are highly susceptible to strategic reporting. Ultimately, however, we show that supplementing mechanisms with realistic parametric statistical models can, in some cases, improve performance along both dimensions of our analysis and result in mechanisms that strike the best balance between them."
DiComiteFrancesco2014Maad,,Modelling agglomeration and dispersion in RHOMOLO,"Di Comite, Francesco and Kancs, d'Artis",2014,,26352,,,,,Publications Office,Luxembourg,"The dynamic spatial general equilibrium model RHOMOLO with endogenous firm location incorporates multiple sources of agglomeration and dispersion. Agglomeration is driven mainly by increasing returns to scale and localised externalities; dispersion by costly trade and imperfect competition. In RHOMOLO, three mechanisms interact in determining the equilibrium spatial distribution of agents: capital mobility, labour mobility and vertical linkages as captured by costly input-output trade. While households choose their location based on real income differences, firms' spatial equilibrium is determined by the inter-regional equalisation of returns on capital. Illustrative simulation results suggest that in the EU labour mobility has the tendency to magnify the home market effect and the market access effect. In contrast, the market crowding effect seems to dominate the market access effect for capital mobility and vertical linkages. These results are in line with the theoretical literature, where the endogenous location mechanism of labour mobility contains two agglomeration forces and one dispersion force, whereas the endogenous location mechanisms of capital mobility and vertical linkages contain one agglomeration force and one dispersion force."

Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading creates opportunities for prosumers to trade their RES with other prosumers in the LEM. Although several scenarios were proposed in the literature for modelling P2P energy trading, there is still a gap in the literature considering the heterogeneous characteristics of prosumers' bidding preferences during P2P matching in the LEM. In this paper, we present heterogeneous characteristics of bidding preferences for prosumers considering energy quantity, bid/offer price, geographic location, location of agents on the local community and cluster welfare. Moreover, this paper proposes an advanced clustering model for P2P matching in the energy community considering the heterogeneous characteristics of bidding preferences for prosumers. For evaluating our proposed model performance, two German real case scenarios of a small and large communities were studied. The simulations results show that using price preference, as the criterion for clustering, offers more technical and economic benefits to energy communities compared to other clustering scenarios. On the other hand, clustering scenarios based on location of prosumers ensure that energy is traded among prosumers who are closer to each other."

However, specific recommendations about the type ofNSAID orCOX-2 could not be made due to high levels of uncertainty in the economic evaluation. Objective : To investigate the value of obtaining further evidence to inform the economic evaluation of NSAIDs, COX-2s and PPIs for people with OA. Methods : An economic evaluation with an expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis was conducted, using a Markov model with data identified from a systematic review. The base-case model used adverse event data from the three largest randomized trials of COX-2 inhibitors, and we repeated the analysis using observational adverse event data. The model was run for a hypothetical population of people with OA, and subgroup analyses were conducted for people with raised gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) risk. The EVPI was based upon the OA population in England — approximately 2.8 million people. Of these, 50% were assumed to use NSAIDs or COX-2 selective inhibitors for 3 months per year and 56% of these were assumed to be patients with raised GI and CV risk. Results : The value of further information for this decision problem was very high. Population-level EVPI was £85.1 million in the low-risk group and £179.5 million in the high-risk group (2007–8 values). Expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) analysis showed that the groups of parameters for which further evidence was likely to be of most value were CV adverse event risks and all adverse event rates associated with the specific drugs celecoxib and ibuprofen. The value of perfect information remained high even when observational adverse event data were used. Conclusions : There is a very high value associated with obtaining further information on uncertain parameters for the economic evaluation of NSAIDs, COX-2 selective inhibitors and PPIs for people with OA. Obtaining further randomized or observational information on CV risks is likely to be particularly cost effective."

In addition, this paper also investigates the mediating effects of leader-member exchange (LMX) and emotional exhaustion. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposed a theoretical model hypothesizing the linkages between the abovementioned variables. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses using a data set from a sample of 605 Filipino call service representatives. Findings The results indicate that perceived customer unfriendliness as a stressor is a positive predictor of emotional exhaustion and emotional dissonance as strains. In turn, emotional exhaustion and emotional dissonance positively influence turnover intent. The results also reveal that LMX mediates the impact of perceived customer unfriendliness on emotional exhaustion. Further, the exhaustion variable mediates the effect of emotional dissonance on turnover intent. Practical implications The results suggest that contact with unfriendly customers has negative emotional implications and highlight the need for training or intervention programs to help service agents develop coping mechanisms. The results also imply that leader-initiated high-quality LMX could help attenuate perceived customer unfriendliness's impact on emotional exhaustion. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge,this paper is the first to examine and confirm the causal relationships of the proposed model's variables using the stress-strain-outcome model."

LarsonDonaldF2013ACMo,,A Conceptual Model of Incomplete Markets and the Consequences for Technology Adoption Policies in Ethiopia,"Larson, Donald F and Gurara, Daniel Zerfu",2013,,6681,,,,,"World Bank, Washington, DC",,"In Africa, farmers have been reluctant to take up new varieties of staple crops developed to boost smallholder yields and rural incomes. Low fertilizer use is often mentioned as a proximate cause, but some believe the problem originates with incomplete input markets. As a remedy, African governments have introduced technology adoption programs with fertilizer subsidies as a core component. Still, the links between market performance and choices about using fertilizer are poorly articulated in empirical studies and policy discussions, making it difficult to judge whether the programs are expected to generate lasting benefits or to simply offset high fertilizer prices. This paper develops a conceptual model to show how choices made by agents supplying input services combine with household livelihood settings to generate heterogeneous decisions about fertilizer use. An applied model is estimated with data from a panel survey in rural Ethiopia. The results suggest that adverse market conditions limit the adoption of fertilizer-based technologies, especially among resource-poor households. Farmers appear to respond to market signals in the aggregate and this provides a pathway for subsidies to stimulate demand. However, the research suggests that lowering transaction costs, through investments in infrastructure and market institutions, can generate deeper effects by expanding the technologies available to farmers across all pricing outcomes."

The non-stationary nature of the palm oil price complicates the modelling and forecasting of its behaviour. This study investigates the impact of the external and internal shocks on Malaysian palm oil (MPO) prices using the SVAR methodology. The SVAR model utilised in this study is unique in that it employs the news-based indices called the Infectious Disease Volatility Tracker (IDVT) and the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPUI) as parts of the time series. News-based indices can potentially uncover essential proxies for economic and policy conditions, as well as portend the investment decision-making and in turn the commodity prices. The rationale behind this choice is to capture the impact from perception and news-based indices on the Malaysian palm oil prices. The empirical result from impulse-response function (IRF) shows that the shock in IDVT has a significant positive impact on Malaysian palm oil prices suggesting the MPO is exposed to the external factor. In addition, amongst the external variables tested, IDVT shows the longest lasting and highest positive impact on Malaysian palm oil prices. These results are in accordance with forecast error variance decomposition which indicates that IDVT shock can explain a huge portion of MPO prices especially over a longer period. The model specified in this study is also sufficiently stable and robust. This study contributes to the literature the significance of news-based indices and their capability in influencing public perception on the current macroeconomic condition, hence influencing the decision-making process of economic agents."

Then the Fishing Regulatory Authority allows each fisher to reconsider the harvesting decision at fixed (discrete) periods of time. The model derives from an Italian fisheries management experience in the Northern Adriatic Sea, where this kind of “self‐adjusting” fishing policy has been proposed to regulate harvesting of two shellfish species. The proposed dynamic model assumes the form of a hybrid system, as the natural growth functions of the two species (in continuous time) are coupled with a discrete time adaptive system that regulates how agents switch from one harvesting strategy to the other period by period according to an evolutionary mechanism based on profit comparison. In order to obtain some insights into the basic mechanisms of the system, some relevant benchmark cases are analyzed before tackling (mainly numerically) the complete hybrid model. Our results suggest that, for proper sets of parameters, this kind of myopic and adaptive self‐regulation may ensure a virtuous trade‐off between profit maximization and resource conservation, driven by cost externalities and market pressure."

In this paper, an intelligent agent (using the Fuzzy SARSA learning approach) is proposed to negotiate for bilateral contracts (BC) of electrical energy in Block Forward Markets (BFM or similar market environments). In the BFM energy markets, the buyers (or loads) and the sellers (or generators) submit their bids and offers on a daily basis. The loads and generators could employ intelligent software agents to trade energy in BC markets on their behalves. Since each agent attempts to choose the best bid/offer in the market, conflict of interests might happen. In this work, the trading of energy in BC markets is modeled and solved using Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. The Stackelberg equation concept is used for the match making among load and generator agents. Then to overcome the negotiation limited time problems (it is assumed that a limited time is given to each generator–load pairs to negotiate and make an agreement), a Fuzzy SARSA Learning (FSL) method is used. The fuzzy feature of FSL helps the agent cope with continuous characteristics of the environment and also prevents it from the curse of dimensionality. The performance of the FSL (compared to other well-known traditional negotiation techniques, such as time-dependent and imitative techniques) is illustrated through simulation studies. The case study simulation results show that the FSL based agent could achieve more profits compared to the agents using other reviewed techniques in the BC energy market."
RobbertThomas2015Fnad,,Feeling nickeled and dimed – consequences of drip pricing,"Robbert, Thomas",2015,Journal of service theory and practice,25,5,621-635,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,Leeds,"Purpose – In drip pricing, companies advertise low prices for products or services and then tack on additional surcharges later in the purchase process. This tactic has not only become popular for airlines but also for other online services, such as retailers and telecommunication companies. Despite the widespread use of drip pricing in the marketplace, little is known about its effects on consumer behavior. The purpose of this paper is to compare the effects of drip pricing with those of price partitioning. Specifically, it elaborates on perceived value, perceived deception, purchase intentions, and the moderating effect of price consciousness. Design/methodology/approach – The paper develops a conceptual framework and tests four hypotheses with an experimental study on a purchase decision for a continental flight booked through an online travel agent. The experiment is based on a between-subjects design with two groups (n=130). The data are analyzed with multivariate statistics and structural equation modeling. Findings – The findings reveal that drip pricing for service offerings leads to inferior results compared with partitioned pricing in terms of perceived value, perceived deception, and, ultimately, purchase intentions. The findings also indicate that the effects differ depending on the customer’s price consciousness. Originality/value – The study draws from previous studies on partitioned pricing and replicates their findings. However, it is one of the first studies to elaborate on moderators and mediators of the consequences of drip pricing in a service context."

The relevant control is the routing policy, that is, the decision concerning which agent should handle an arriving call when more than one agent is available. We formulate an optimization problem for a call center with heterogeneous agent pools, in which each pool is distinguished by the speed at which agents in that pool handle calls. The objective is to minimize steady-state expected customer wait time subject to a ""fairness"" constraint on the workload division. We first solve the optimization problem by formulating it as a Markov decision process (MDP), and solving a related linear program. We note that this approach does not in general lead to an optimal policy that has a simple structure. Fortunately, the optimal policy does appear to have a simple structure as the system size grows large, in the Halfin-Whitt many-server heavy-traffic limit regime. Therefore, we solve the diffusion control problem that arises in this regime and interpret its solution as a policy for the original system. The resulting routing policy is a threshold policy that determines server pool priorities based on the total number of customers in the system. We prove that a continuous modification of our proposed threshold routing policy is asymptotically optimal in the Halfin-Whitt limit regime. We furthermore present simulation results to illustrate that our proposed threshold routing policy outperforms a common routing policy used in call centers (that routes to the agent that has been idle the longest)."

Proceedings,,,1-,,,Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE),Norcross,"Obesity is a major health problem, which is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke. In addition to health consequences, obesity also may affect productivity in the workplace. Previous research has associated obesity with a number of ergonomic risk factors or concerns including: decreases in productivity and increases in workplace injuries, job stress, absenteeism, health service needs, and insurance costs. There are a wide range of psychosocial, socioeconomic, personal and economic factors contributing to obesity. Therefore, finding promising techniques for effective investigation of obesity is a challenge. The focus of this research is to identify work system variables that are associated with obesity and propose a conceptual framework to use data mining and agent based modeling to better understand this problem and ultimately to design effective interventions to deal with this issue and its impact on the work environment.

In this study we focused on the agents of a single, mediumsized insurance/financial services concern operating primarily in the Midwest of the United States. Our first inquiry demonstrates that Parasuraman's (2000) Technology Readiness Index (TRI) appears largely generalizable to the insurance industry within the constraints identified in this study. The TRI explains almost two-thirds of the explained variance in agents' self-reported perceptions of technology readiness in our study, and it appears that the positive dimensions of optimism and innovativeness are most influential in facilitating technology readiness. Our second research inquiry concerned developing an e-Consumption model to help better understand how agents form their intentions to adopt and use technology and the Internet. The results suggest that general e-Consumption models from the services marketing literature appear to generalize to this internal marketing research setting. The managerial and research implications of this study are presented and discussed."

The production side of the economy is described by a random growth model with a competitive labor market and an exogenously given random dividend payout ratio. For an isoelastic technology with multiplicative production shocks this implies a random dynamical system for the firm’s rate of profit with a unique asymptotically stable random fixed point for a large class of productivity growth and dividend payout ratio processes. Based on an extensive numerical study of stationary solutions we show that the two consumption scenarios imply a limited number of diverse effects regarding equity and bond returns and equity premia.
AndersonLeigh2014EtCo,,Evaluating the Consequences of Second Generation Bioenergy Crops on a Grain/Livestock Economy: An Example of the Canadian Prairies,"Anderson, Leigh and Schoney, Richard and Nolan, James",2014,,,,,,,,,"Biofuels are used as renewable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Government agricultural policies are currently focused on the production and use of so-called first-generation biofuels (FGB). Partly because of the success of many FGB programs, concerns about food and water security have become important considerations in the policy arena. These considerations have led to the development of so-called second-generation biofuel (SGB) technologies, based on relatively low value feedstocks that thrive on marginal land. This changes the competitive environment for biofuels, as SGB’s do not need to compete directly with relatively high-value annual crops. To examine consequences of this situation on the future of mixed farming, we develop an agent based simulation model (ABSM) for the analysis of economic situations characterized by large numbers of dynamically interacting individuals located on a heterogeneous landscape. Like most policies designed with good societal intentions, we find that SGB crops may lead to significant and possibly unwanted trade-offs in agricultural economies. If energy prices become high enough, the model indicates that structural changes in the farming sector will be significant, resulting in a very different agricultural landscape than we see today."

This strand of literature on multinational subsidiaries has provided the necessary analytical models and research tools to study the phenomenon. Nonetheless, while many studies exist on the roles, strategies and evolutions of subsidiaries, and despite its high importance, this area of academic research is still lacking critical mass. Moreover, the extant studies have been conducted in the context of advanced economies, and yet it has been under-researched in the context of emerging economies, and particularly the economies of Eastern Europe, the so-called new EU member states. The study of the phenomenon of subsidiary evolution is the main aim of this paper. Design/methodology/approach – The paper makes use of a proprietary dataset, collected in a self-administered web-based survey conducted among foreign-owned companies in Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. To test the interrelations between different variables, the paper uses the structural equitation modelling, an advanced technique that allows to account for multiple interdependencies in a model. This approach enables the authors to escape the rigid division between dependent and independent variables, inherent to most conventional econometric models. In the paper, three analytical structural equation modelling (SEM) models were developed, tested and compared. Findings – The empirical analyses show a strong positive relation between the main drivers of subsidiary evolution and the key outcomes of this process. It shows that the tenets of the theory originally developed to describe strategic behaviour of subsidiaries in advanced Western countries, broadly holds for emerging economies too. Moreover, the paper shows that subsidiaries operating in dynamic environments and led by pro-active subsidiary management achieve better results. Research limitations/implications – The study has its limitations. It is of quantitative nature, whereby the most common feature and characteristics of the research object are studied. Despite the convincing results, the phenomenon of subsidiary evolution can be further investigated in a number of case studies in a dynamic perspective, where specific details may come under the spotlight. On the other hand, such results cannot be easily generalised. Originality/value – This study contributes to the extant body of academic literature on subsidiary evolution. The main contribution comes from investigation of this complex phenomenon in the context of emerging economies of new EU member states. Their transitionary dynamics and transformative change have had a profound impact on the functioning of economic agents and foreign subsidiaries in particular. The paper finds important particularities of this context."

When the actual inflation is realised, an agent is in a position to learn, i.e., adjust his own network strategy and belief. The learning is modelled as an evolving network process, i.e., a network of agents, with non-zero communication costs. Our simulation results suggest that the network economy as a whole acts efficiently in achieving convergence to the Pareto superior equilibrium, in which an agent’s perception of information is through communication and is subject to available resources.

Data on a sample of 212 such professionals across 11 companies were analyzed using structured equation modeling. Maximum likelihood estimate method was used to test the extent of model fit. Mediation has been confirmed through bootstrapping.FindingsResults reveal a significant direct relationship between PSS and turnover intention. POS and PCS were found to have significant indirect effects on turnover intention, mediated by affective commitment.Research limitations/implicationsOverall results prompt the authors to recommend that organizations in insurance business must invest resources in promoting organizational support and also adopt a supportive work culture in which social exchange can easily occur. Level of withdrawal intention among sales professionals can be lowered by establishing emotional bonding with them. Supervisors may also be provided adequate training in soft skills to support their subordinates.Originality/valueThis study has highlighted that support at workplace is a binding force between an employee and his/her organization, and thus it negatively affects his/her withdrawal intention directly or indirectly via affective commitment. This paper stands out in the multitude of existing research as especially the relation of PCS and turnover intention has been explored less. It also adds to the scarce literature available on turnover intention among liquid knowledge workers in Indian insurance sector."
BustosTuruGonzalo2018Imff,,Integrated modelling framework for the analysis of demand side management strategies in urban energy systems,"Bustos Turu, Gonzalo",2018,,,,,,,"Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London",,"Influenced by environmental concerns and rapid urbanisation, cities are changing the way they historically have produced, distributed and consumed energy. In the next decades, cities will have to increasingly adapt their energy infrastructure if new low carbon and smart technologies are to be effectively integrated. In this context, advanced planning tools can become crucial to successfully design these future urban energy systems. However, it is not only important to analyse how urban energy infrastructure will look like in the future, but also how they will be operated. Advanced energy management strategies can increase the operational efficiency, therefore reducing energy consumption, CO2 emissions, operational costs and network investments. However, the design and analysis of these energy management strategies are difficult to perform at an urban scale considering the spatial and temporal resolution and the diversity in users energy requirements. This thesis proposes a novel integrated modelling framework to analyse flexible transport and heating energy demand and assess different demand-side management strategies in urban energy systems. With a combination of agent-based simulation and multi-objective optimisation models, this framework is tested using two case studies. The first one focuses on transport electrification and the integration of electric vehicles through smart charging strategies in an urban area in London, UK. The results of this analysis show that final consumer costs and carbon emissions reductions (compared to a base case) are in the range of 4.3-45.0% and 2.8-3.9% respectively in a daily basis, depending on the type of tariff and electricity generation mix considered. These reductions consider a control strategy where the peak demand is constrained so the capacity of the system is not affected. In the second case study, focused on heat electrification, the coordination of a group of heat pumps is analysed, using different scheduling strategies. In this case, final consumer costs and carbon emissions can be reduced in the range of 4-41% and 0.02-0.7% respectively on a daily basis. In this case, peak demand can be reduced in the range of 51-62% with respect to the baseline. These case studies highlight the importance of the spatial and temporal characterisation of the energy demand, and the level of flexibility users can provide to the system when considering a heterogeneous set of users with different technologies, energy requirements and behaviours. In both studies, trade-offs between the environmental and economic performance of demand-side management strategies are assessed using a multi-objective optimisation approach. Finally, further applications of the integrated modelling framework are described to highlight its potential as a decision-making support tool in sustainable and smart urban energy systems."

AlcoforadoRG2021Mrfc,,Modelling risk for commodities in Brazil: An application to live cattle spot and futures prices,"Alcoforado, R G and Bernardino, W and A D Egídio dos Reis and Santos, J A C",2021,arXiv.org,,,,,,"Cornell University Library, arXiv.org",Ithaca,"This study analysed a series of live cattle spot and futures prices from the Boi Gordo Index (BGI) in Brazil. The objective was to develop a model that best portrays this commodity's behaviour to estimate futures prices more accurately. The database created contained 2,010 daily entries in which trade in futures contracts occurred, as well as BGI spot sales in the market, from 1 December 2006 to 30 April 2015. One of the most important reasons why this type of risk needs to be measured is to set loss limits. To identify patterns in price behaviour in order to improve future transactions' results, investors must analyse fluctuations in assets' value for longer periods. Bibliographic research revealed that no other study has conducted a comprehensive analysis of this commodity using this approach. Cattle ranching is big business in Brazil given that in 2017, this sector moved 523.25 billion Brazilian reals (about 130.5 billion United States dollars). In that year, agribusiness contributed 22% of Brazil's total gross domestic product. Using the proposed risk modelling technique, economic agents can make the best decision about which options within these investors' reach produce more effective risk management. The methodology was based on Holt-Winters exponential smoothing algorithm, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ARIMA with exogenous inputs, generalised autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic and generalised autoregressive moving average (GARMA) models. More specifically, 5 different methods were applied that allowed a comparison of 12 different models as ways to portray and predict the BGI commodity's behaviour. The results show that GARMA with order c(2,1) and without intercept is the best model."

Two different models are developed: one for the situation where the supplier has superior bargaining power over the buyer, and the other for the reverse situation. For each model, a method is derived that employs game theory-based analysis to determine the best strategy for each agent. A computational experiment is conducted to estimate the efficiency of the methods and to determine the economic implications of the results. The result indicates that each algorithm is very efficient compared to other strategies. We also verify that the solutions derived from each model are Nash equilibrium. Significantly improved outcomes are obtained for both agents by agreeing to the terms generated by the algorithms over the terms selected in the usual manner."

Design/methodology/approach - Using the structural equation model, cause and effect relationships were identified between the proposed model's constructs, and indices of quality, satisfaction and loyalty among tourists were estimated. This system was applied to a large set of data collected with a structured questionnaire distributed to tourists visiting the city of Seville through a non-probabilistic sampling by intentional quotas method. In total, 922 valid surveys were obtained. Findings - The indices show that tourists who visit Seville report a high level of loyalty to, and satisfaction with, this place because of the perceived quality of a variety of services. It is observed that the perceived quality index is much higher (17.95 per cent) than the expected quality index, so the quality of the service received by the tourist during his/her visit to Seville is described as excellent. Research limitations/implications - Regarding this study's limitations, other variables could have been included that influence tourist satisfaction, such as the climate, the effect of advertising medium, the prices and the emotional components. In addition, surveying tourists expectations before their visit is virtually impossible, as is surveying the same tourists again about their perceived value and satisfaction after their visit. Future lines of research could focus on the intersection of information between tourism offer and demand, providing information about an appropriate balance in specific markets. The proposed model can also be applied to other tourism places that are similar to Seville's tourism offer, allowing useful comparisons and identification of critical points and ways to improve customer satisfaction continuously. Practical implications - By establishing indices of expected and perceived quality and satisfaction and loyalty among tourists, tourism authorities and different economic agents involved in this sector can receive objective information about the results and quality of tourism services. Tourism managers, thus, can set objectives for improvements and competitiveness, as well as building and maintaining customer loyalty. At the same time, these indices allow comparisons with other organisations and places. By facilitating greater transparency in the measurement of quality and satisfaction, service providers connected to tourism can create a platform on which to articulate clearly their contributions to interested parties and local communities. Social implications - These results constitute strategies and findings that any tourism place has to consider in the planning and development of its products. Therefore the model can help to encourage a long-term market perspective among tourism sector regulators, investors and agencies. With the information obtained with this model, areas needing improvement can be identified and the appropriate procedures can be put into practice to improve the tourism offer, adjusting it to meet travellers' needs according to their motivations to travel to the destination. Residents also can benefit from these measures, as their quality of life will improve through upgrades of the city's tourism facilities. Originality/value - The unique contribution of the present study lies in how the indices or indicators of quality of, satisfaction with and loyalty to destinations among tourists are easily measured by applying structural equation modelling. A new approach to measure satisfaction, loyalty and quality is used based on a scale from 0 to 100, and the index results are very useful for comparing different tourist places."

PavoniSilvia2019TNSO,,THE NEW SCIENCE OF RISK MANAGEMENT,"Pavoni, Silvia",2019,The Banker,,,20-,,,The Financial Times Limited,London,"""What we set out to do was to develop a dynamic platform to do stress testing at the system level rather than the level of individual financial institutions, which was really the prevailing approach leading up to and through the financial crisis,"" says Brian Tivnan, Mitre's models and simulation chief engineer, who led the team that developed such a solution for the US Treasury. Traditional risk models had focused on the value at risk at individual institutions and then, with the introduction of stress testing by banking supervisors after the financial crisis, on taking a picture of how each bank would perform should a series of shocks be introduced in its environment. [...]there are applications beyond risk management too, as agent-based modelling simulations can also be used in investment, such as in benchmarking exercises to discover best execution standards to help meet the more stringent requirements imposed by the second reiter ation of Europe's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (better known as MiFID II). Looking at individual banks' vulnerabilities, for example, unstructured data such as social media interactions or personal habits captured by mobile phone data have proved useful indicators of customers' reliability and character, according to Evgueni Ivantsov, chairman of the European Risk Management Council. The discussed introduction of a standardised floor on capital requirements as part of the review of internal models of Basel III (and its subsequent changes, often referred to as 'Basel IV') might redirect focus away from the creation of internal regulatory models, reducing flexibility but closing the gap with day-to-day risk management models, according to Mr Gabbi; this could ""avoid that, internally, a bank had the 'right' model, more oriented on risks, [while] the one that it asks supervisors to validate is more capital management oriented""."
LahoutiAli2023MCPE,,Modelling Construction Production Environments as Complex Adaptive Systems,"Lahouti, Ali and Abdelhamid, Tariq S.",2023,,,,137-156,,,Routledge,,"Around 1992, some researchers questioned the failures of project management to deliver on the mantra of 'on-time, at budget, and at desired quality' and the low workflow reliability on a weekly basis on construction projects. This low reliability resulted in out-of-sequence work and various costly firefighting mitigation approaches by contractors to bring projects on track. Lean Construction, with an underlying theoretical foundation in the Transformation (T), Flow (F), and Value generation (V) theory of production, was conceived as a more overarching production management paradigm. Continued developments in information technology and reliance on digital solutions have signalled the need to explore the integration into existing methods as well as considering the possibility of yet broader theories of project-based production systems. In this chapter, the role of digital and smart technology in facilitating the understanding of crew planning and management of production operations is introduced and discussed. Specifically, crew responses to field problems, crew actions to varying site conditions from drawings, and crew choreography are emphasized. The key role of technology is allowing experimentation with multiple scenarios without subjecting any crew member to the possibility of injury. In addition, digital and smart technology allows the representation of the construction environments as complex adaptive systems.

A directive refers to 'the information or instructions required for the construction crew' to start a task - e.g., submittals, construction specifications, shop drawings; and request-for-information. The mismatch between provided directives and existing situations is certainly one source of ambiguity forcing a work crew to improvise."

New prospective (or ex ante) methods are needed to assess the impacts of these changes. Prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) can contribute by detailed analysis of environmental consequences. A new stream of research has taken up the challenge to create prospective life cycle inventory (LCI) databases, building on projections of integrated assessment models to describe future changes in technology use and their underlying environmental performance. The present work extends on this by addressing the research question on how to project life cycle impact assessment methods for water scarcity consistent with prospective LCI modeling. Water scarcity characterization factors are projected from 2010–2050 using the AWARE method, based on SSP‐RCP scenario results of the integrated assessment model IMAGE. This work is coupled with prospective LCI databases, where electricity datasets are adapted based on the energy component of IMAGE for the same scenario. Based on this, an LCA case study of water desalination for the steel industry in Spain is presented. The resulting regional characterization factors show that some regions (i.e., the Iberian Peninsula) could experience an increase in water scarcity in the future. Results of the case study show how this can lead to trade‐offs between climate change and water scarcity impacts and how disregarding such trends could lead to biased assessments. The relevance and limitations are finally discussed, highlighting further research needs, such as the temporalization of the impacts."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of utility measurements to examine the performance of preference-based instruments, estimate health utility of patients with HIV/AIDS by disease stages, and investigate changes in their health utility over the course of antiretroviral treatment. Methods: We searched PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Web of Science for English-language peer-reviewed papers published during 2000-2013. We selected 49 studies that used 3 direct and 6 indirect preference based instruments to make a total of 218 utility measurements. Random effect models with robust estimation of standard errors and multivariate fractional polynomial regression were used to obtain the pooled estimates of utility and model their trends. Results: Reliability of direct-preference measures tended to be lower than other types of measures. Utility elicited by two of the indirect preference measures - SF-6D (0.171) and EQ-5D (0.114), and that of Time-Trade off (TTO) (0.151) was significantly different than utility elicited by Standard Gamble (SG). Compared to asymptomatic HIV patients, symptomatic and AIDS patients reported a decrement of 0.025 (p  = 0.40) and 0.176 (p  = 0.001) in utility scores, adjusting for method of assessment. In longitudinal studies, the pooled health utility of HIV/AIDS patients significantly decreased in the first 3 months of treatment, and rapidly increased afterwards. Magnitude of change varied depending on the method of assessment and length of antiretroviral treatment. Conclusion: The study provides an accumulation of evidence on measurement properties of health utility estimates that can help inform the selection of instruments for future studies. The pooled estimates of health utilities and their trends are useful in economic evaluation and policy modelling of HIV/AIDS treatment strategies."

This paper proposes the design of a multi-agent system for internet virtual chartering markets (MAVCM). The MAVCM system applies for business-to-business transactions in maritime markets, and provides mechanisms for Internet-based chartering informational and transactional services. The lifecycle of the proposed system offers a solution for efficiently handling the processes involving a charterer who owns the cargo and employs a shipbroker to find a shipowner to deliver the cargo for a certain freight rate. The objective is to enable maritime market participants to electronically charter, trade and transport cargos based on information and transactions over Internet via their software agents. The roles of the identified MAVCM software agents as well as the processes of the involved agents in a chartering application scenario are described. Agent methodologies and technologies for the analysis and the design of an e-chartering system are presented. The GAIA methodology and A-UMI have been used in the design methodology employed and have been applied for the visual specification of the present pilot application scenario."

Two haemostatic agents with different bypassing mechanisms have been used in the treatment of patients with inhibitors: activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). To date, published analyses on costs and outcomes in inhibitor treatment have been based on comparatively small samples and on expert opinion. Existing comparisons have used decision-analytic modelling. DATA: The FENOC study used a prospective, crossover design where each patient used activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA®) at one bleed and recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven®) at another bleed. The order of bypassing agents was randomised. The resource use and haemostatic efficacy was recorded at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours following treatment. Time until bleeding had stopped was also evaluated. Forty-eight pairs (96 bleeding episodes) were included in the analysis. METHODS: Two types of health-economic analysis were performed: cost analysis identifying the determinants of cost using regression methods, and cost-effectiveness analysis to relate resource use to three measures of outcome; patient perception of treatment efficacy (defined as effective and/or partially effective), whether the bleeding had stopped and reduction in patient-perceived pain on a Visual Analogue Scale from start of treatment. Confidence intervals (CI) of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated by bootstrap. The sensitivity of results were tested using the different relative prices in the US (Red Book AWP) and Sweden (national negotiated prices from the Swedish Pharmaceutical Benefits Board). RESULTS: Key determinants of cost were prescribed dose per kg bodyweight, weighing relatively more than persons of the same age and treatment in addition to protocol. FEIBA® cost on average less (p<0.0001) than NovoSeven® at all measurement points during 48h while it had slightly higher (but not significantly) percentages of efficacy measured by patient perception of treatment and whether the bleeding had stopped at all but one time point. A slightly higher proportion considered NovoSeven® effective/partially effective at 12 hours after treatment start. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were negative with wide, but negative, CIs. The same analysis measuring outcome by reduction in pain from start of treatment gave less clear results due to a considerable variation at the individual level. By 48h after start of treatment, more than half of the patients reported significantly better results with one of the products. However, this group was evenly divided between the two bypassing agents. The different relative prices in the US and Sweden mattered, but did not reverse the main results. CONCLUSIONS: Health-economic analysis from the FENOC study indicated that FEIBA® was a dominant strategy having on average lower cost and slightly higher percentages of patient-stated efficacy. The large variation at the individual level of the two bypassing agents' effect on reduction of pain supports 1) decisions that take the individual patient's experience into account,2) decisions that make trade-offs between cost and reduction in pain rather than focusing on cost only,3) further research on the underlying causes of differences in reduction of pain."

The length of the momentum period is inversely related to both the amount of information-based trading in the market and the rate at which asset specific information is learned by boundedly rational agents. Furthermore, the model allows explicitly to establish a link between the component of the bid-ask spread that can be explained by bounded rationality and both momentum and reversal."

As such, real time control and prediction methods present a significant challenge. For diseases which spread through direct human interaction, (e.g., transferred from infected to susceptible individuals) the contagion process can be modeled on a social-contact network where individuals are represented as nodes, and contacts between individuals are represented as links. The model presented in this paper seeks to identify the infection pattern which depicts the current state of an ongoing outbreak. This is accomplished by inferring the most likely paths of infection through a contact network under the assumption of partially available infection data. The problem is formulated as a bi-linear integer program, and heuristic solution methods are developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The heuristic performance is presented for a range of randomly generated networks and different levels of information. The model results, which include the most likely set of infection spreading contacts, can be used to provide insight into future epidemic outbreak patterns, and aid in the development of intervention strategies."

Fuhrer and Moore proposed a new formulation, which they referred to as the relative contracting model, which exhibits persistent in inflation. As a justification for their new model, Fuhrer and Moore argue that agents care about relative real wages, and not about nominal wages. In this note, it is argued that this motivation is misleading. Fuhrer and Moore's model is based on agents caring about the real wages that other workers obtained in the past. If Fuhrer and Moore's model were modified so that workers cared about the contemporaneous real wages of otehr workers, which is arguably the more reasonable assumption, then the model coincides with the standard formulation of Taylor (1980)."

When calibrated to both consumption and production data, the model is able to generate significative home bias in equity portfolios. A new methodology, based on Malliavin calculus, is presented to solve for the portfolio policies along the equilibrium path. This methodology allows one to reduce the determination of equilibrium portfolio holdings to the solution of a linear algebraic system, rather than a partial differential equation."

Based on a previous work which has calibrated a first instantiation of the mobility model to the Paris region, we extend it by modeling and simulating two forms of intermodality: Park-and-Walk and Park-and-Ride. After re-calibrating the model, we evaluate two policy scenarios featuring different scales of the restriction zone, using indicators related to mobility, traffic emissions, and social cost. The analysis puts special attention on how modal shift and emissions vary across space, that is, inside and outside the policy zone. We find that the small-scale scenario with a restriction zone limited to the Paris center leads to very limited modal shift, whereas the larger-scale policy scenario encompassing the whole of Paris shifts significantly more trips (about 1.4% of total trips) from cars to public transport and other modes. In both scenarios, traffic emissions decline in the restriction zone and its near surroundings. Far from the restriction zone, however, emissions increase in the small-scale scenario but decrease in the large-scale scenario. These differences are caused by the traffic detour, modal shift, and rebound effects, the magnitudes of which vary depending on the scale of the restriction zone. The driving restrictions also cause the social cost to increase by around 10% in both scenarios. This ultimately implies a trade-off between reducing emissions and increasing user costs, with a substantially greater efficiency (larger reduction for similar cost) in the large-scale policy scenario."

The beer market in Ukraine and the main trends in it are analyzed. The geographical structure of Ukraine’s beer export and import is investigated. The main stages of the brewing industry entering international markets are considered. The construction of a gravity model makes it possible to make qualitative forecast of the development state of markets for economic agents of the national economy. That is, the gravity model is primarily a tool for modeling trade flows of a particular product among countries. Based on the gravity model, it is possible to assess effectiveness of international trade. In our case, as a result of constructing the gravity model and testing it using forecast indicators, the most promising markets for export activities of brewing enterprises are determined. The gravity model of international trade in beer based on the trade balance is adapted. The constructed model is tested, and potential partner countries for export operations are identified.

While supported empirically, these characteristic-based models lack theoretical support. This paper seeks to reformulate an asset-pricing model (RAPM) to demonstrate why firm characteristics help to explain stock returns.Design methodology approach - The RAPM is grounded in an economic setting where two groups of agents hold different beliefs about firm fundamental values, and the more sophisticated group (rationals) adopts contrarian strategies against the naïve group (quasis). The model is derived in a static equilibrium within the consumption-investment framework with heterogeneous agents.Findings - The key theoretical result is a parsimonious equation of cross-sectional expected returns that not only are specified by the traditional risk-return relation, but also are determined by contrarian adjustments at both market-wide and firm-specific levels. When the model is taken to empirical specifications, it leads to consistent explanations for the behaviors of growth and value stocks, and for size and book-to-market effects.Research limitations implications - The RAPM is a one-period model that assumes that ""rationals"" have perfect knowledge about ""quasis"" sentiment parameter and their relative market weights. In future research, it is planned to extend this static model to multiple periods to incorporate a learning process by which ""rationals"" learn these parameters over time.Practical implications - The RAPM clearly identifies four criteria for implementing arbitrage opportunities in investments. These criteria formalize the common practices in the mutual hedge fund industry.Originality value - The paper develops an original framework that formally supports the characteristics-based models. It offers insights for researchers in behavioral finance and guidelines for investment practitioners."

Main objective of the paper is to generalize the order waiting time process in order to properly model such empirical evidences. The empirical study is performed on the best bid and best ask data of 7 U.S. financial markets, for 30-stock time series. In particular, statistical properties of trading waiting times have been analyzed and quality of fits is evaluated by suitable statistical tests, i.e., comparing empirical distributions with theoretical models. Starting from the statistical studies on real data, attention has been focused on the reproducibility of such results in an artificial market. The computational experiments have been performed within the Genoa Artificial Stock Market. In the market model, heterogeneous agents trade one risky asset in exchange for cash. Agents have zero intelligence and issue random limit or market orders depending on their budget constraints. The price is cleared by means of a limit order book. The order generation is modelled with a renewal process. Based on empirical trading estimation, the distribution of waiting times between two consecutive orders is modelled by a mixture of exponential processes. Results show that the empirical waiting-time distribution can be considered as a generalization of a Poisson process. Moreover, the renewal process can approximate real data and implementation on the artificial stocks market can reproduce the trading activity in a realistic way."
KantShashi2013PFRE,,Post-Faustmann Forest Resource Economics,"Kant, Shashi",2013,,4,,,,,Springer Nature,Dordrecht,"The current paradigm of forest economics is based on Faustmann Formulation (FF) of land expectation value proposed by Martin Faustmann. It was a great achievement by a forester to propose a formulation that captures some fundamental economic features of capital theory which. However, the followers of the FF approach have trapped themselves into the past, and have not shown any indication of economic acumen of the great Faustmann. This has resulted in a common problem in the current paradigm of forest economics, known as Faustmann Forest Resource Economics (FFRE), to prescribe the application of a single (FF) approach to all situations irrespective of the specific features of the situation. The current state of forest economics is similar to that of neoclassical economics, and is full of inefficiencies. In neoclassical economics, inefficiencies are due to its ""locked-in position in rational economic man, while in forest economics inefficiencies are due to its ""locked-in position in the FF. The focus of this volume is on the new paradigm of forest economics termed as Post-Faustmann Forest Resource Economics (PFFRE). The first chapter lays the foundation of the PFFRE, and presents the key distinctions between the FFRE and the PFFRE. The volume includes twelve other chapters that address issues related to forest economics from perspectives different than the FFRE. Chapter 2 to 6 are focused on issues related to human behavior that is different than the rational economic man, Chapter 7 and 8 on public choice theory, Chapter 9 and 10 on systems approaches, and Chapter 11 to 13 on incremental approaches to incorporate new features in the FFRE."
SpiegelMatthew1998SPVi,,Stock Price Volatility in a Multiple Security Overlapping Generations Model,"Spiegel, Matthew",1998,The Review of financial studies,11,2,419-447,,,Oxford University Press,CARY,"A number of empirical studies have reached the conclusion that stock price volatility cannot be fully explained within the standard dividend discount model. This article proposes a resolution based upon a model that contains both a random supply of risky assets and finitely lived agents who trade in a multiple security environment. As the analysis shows there exist 2K equilibria when K securities trade. The low volatility equilibria have properties analogous to those found in the infinitely lived agent models of Campbell and Kyle (1991) and Wang (1993, 1994). In contrast, the high-volatility equilibria have very different characteristics. Within the high-volatility equilibria very large price variances can be generated with very small supply shocks. Adding securities to the economy further reduces the required supply shocks. Using previously established empirical results the model can reconcile the data with supply shocks that are less than 10% as large as observed return shocks. These results are shown to hold even when the dividend process is mean reverting."
SongfengCai2014TIAo,,The Impact Analysis of TTIP on BRICs—based on dynamic GTAP model considering GVC,"Songfeng, Cai and Yaxiong, Zhang and Bo, Meng",2014,,2014,,,,,,,"Within the global value chain (GVC), the intermediate inputs of the products in one country come from various countries around the world, the imported products consumed in domestic may also include the domestic intermediate inputs. Therefore, it is very important to reflect this GVC characteristic when Using GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project) model to analyze the trade policy. Because of the lack of necessary data, the armington assumption of trade linkage is implemented in two levels in the GTAP model: producers and consumers distinguish the domestic variety of a good from its imported variety without regard to the country of origin of the imported input; the sourcing of imported goods is placed at the border of an economy. In order to improve this common approach which simplifies the import decision at the border level, we introduce the WIOD（World Input-Output Database）with a micro-based determination of bilateral trade to place the sourcing of imports at the agent level. In this study, we use the improved dynamic GTAP model (we call it GTAP-GVC model) to assess the economy-wide impact of TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) on BRICs. In the simulation, we mainly do the work in two aspects. Firstly, we reduce both tariff and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) between US and EU. Because average tariff levels on both sides of the Atlantic are relatively low already, various non-tariff barriers or NTBs (often in the form of domestic regulations) on both sides of the Atlantic constitute important impediments to deepening transatlantic trade linkages. For quantification of NTBs, this study has adopted the equivalent tariff levels of NTBs from the research results of Ecorys (2009) to capture the impact of removing NTBs. Secondly, the simulations that are carried out also take into account two sets of possible spillover effects beyond bilateral liberalization. These are defined as follows. First, we have included direct spillover. It is based on the assumption that improved regulatory conditions negotiated between the EU and the US will also result in a limited fall in related trade costs for third countries exporting to the EU and US. A second indirect effect involving third countries is considered as well: the indirect spillover. It means to gauge the economic implications if third countries adopt some of the common standards agreed between the EU and the US."

BradyMark2010Tiod,,The impact of decoupling and modulation in the European Union: a sectoral and farm level assessment,"Brady, Mark and Rabinowicz, Ewa",2010,,,,,,,,,"Introduction of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in 2005 constitutes perhaps the most radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy ever. This payment has replaced almost all previous forms of subsidies to farmers and is decoupled, i.e., paid regardless of whether the farmer produces or not, as long as land is kept in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC). Such a radical reform was expected to have a profound impact on European agriculture. This paper presents a synthesis of the findings of a large EU project, IDEMA. The aim was to assess the potential impacts of decoupling on production, prices, trade flows, farm income, structural change and the environment at the EU and regional levels. Due to the complexity of the issues at hand and the lack of historical data, three complementary evaluation approaches were used: surveys of farmers’ intentions, sector modelling and agent-based models of regional structural change. Surveys and modelling results provide no strong evidence that farmers intend to change their strategic decision to exit agriculture. Instead structural change is shown to slow down when payments are decoupled because minimal land management becomes an additional source of income. Decoupling as a result is also shown to reduce farmers’ off-farm labour supply. In the New Member States the impact of the accession is the dominating effect: the introduction of CAP payments results in larger numbers of farmers remaining in the sector and increased competition for land. Other aims of the reform included boosting farm incomes and improving competitiveness. The reform has also, undoubtedly, increased market orientation of EU farmers and reduced trade distortions. The SPS is shown to increase farm incomes but also land rental prices in most regions. Capitalization of payments in land values over time will, however, erode the ability of the reform to support incomes in the long run as incumbent farmers retire or otherwise leave the sector. The impacts of the reform would have been very different if there was no link between the decoupled payment and land. Without the GAEC obligation model results indicate a strong increase in average farm size as greater numbers of farmers would leave the sector and make their land available to remaining farms (significant areas of land are though shown to be abandoned in the most marginal regions). Due to the significantly lower land (rental) prices and size economies that emerge from this policy, profits per hectare are generally higher. Thus it can be argued that the objective of improving competitiveness has not been achieved due to slower structural change and the higher land prices that follow from the 2003 reform"

The interaction between the aforementioned participants will be modeled using the game theory approach. Under non-cooperative and cooperative games, the optimal sale price, warranty period and warranty price for the manufacturer and the optimal maintenance cost (repair cost) and marketing expenditure for the agent are obtained by maximizing their profits. The satisfaction of the customer is also maximized by being able to choose one of the suggested options from the manufacturer and the agent, based on the risk parameter. Design/methodology/approach Three-echelon supply chains with marketing and warranty services are studied. Game-theoretic approaches (non-cooperative and cooperative) are presented. The non-cooperative approaches are static (NE) and dynamic (Stakelberg) models. The cooperative approach is related to bargaining models (Nash bargaining games). The authors develop a sensitivity analysis of some parameters and their effect. Findings Based on the mentioned drawbacks (i.e. lack of a model containing warranty, marketing and pricing), despite their importance, a developed model is proposed in this research to cover one of the research gaps. In addition, main contributions of this paper that differentiate it from the existing papers are regarding inventory, lost sale and lost goodwill, which are significant in the comparison environment. Another advantage of this study is related to the solution approach, the game theory. Twofold of the games theoretical, i.e. cooperative (in three forms) and non-cooperative are considered, because of their importance. Three types of non-cooperative games are presented as follows: Nash equilibrium - each echelon decides respectively and simultaneously; manufacturer-Stackelberg - the manufacturer has more power than the agent and the agent has more power than the customer; and customer-Stackelberg - customer is leader of the agent and the agent is the leader of manufacturer. The involved cooperative game in this paper is the bargaining problem that the participants can determine how to share the additional profits. Originality/value In this paper, various three-level service contracts will be presented among the following three participants: a manufacturer, an agent and a customer. The interaction between the aforementioned participants will be modeled using the game theory approach. Under non-cooperative and cooperative games, the optimal sale price, warranty period and warranty price for the manufacturer and the optimal maintenance cost (repair cost) and marketing expenditure for the agent are obtained by maximizing their profits. The satisfaction of the customer is also maximized by being able to choose one of the suggested options from the manufacturer and the agent, based on the risk parameter. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the models presented in this paper. Finally, the authors develop a sensitivity analysis of some parameters and their effects on the objective functions."
BertramGeoff1999TMMT,,The MIRAB Model Twelve Years On,"Bertram, Geoff",1999,The Contemporary Pacific,11,1,105-138,,,CENTER FOR PACIFIC ISLANDS STUDIES & UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I PRESS,HONOLULU,"Developed in the mid 1980s to explain economic processes in New Zealand's sphere of influence in the Pacific islands, the MIRAB model has proved applicable across a wide range of island economies. Identifying features of a MIRAB economy are heavy reliance on transfer payments, including repatriated factor incomes, to finance current expenditure; a migration process that disperses the members of ethnic groups across geographical space while retaining the organic unity of families and communities; and a consequent transnationalization of the society's economic activity whenever external niches of economic opportunity become accessible. Production of tradable goods is marginalized by the operation of market forces in the absence of regulation, and policies to promote tradable-led development have little application. The paper presents macroeconomic data to illustrate three stylized facts for MIRAB economies: persistent gaps between national expenditure and gross domestic product, a combination of large trade deficits with balanced current accounts (and hence limited debt accumulation), and the long-run stability of per capita aid flows. Some country-specific variations on the basic MIRAB model in the recent literature are reviewed, along with some recent economic literature on the microeconomics of transnational networks of kin and community."

Individuals play a higher order best response to samples from the empirical data on the history of play, where the order of best response is determined by their exogenously given level of cognition. As in Young’s model of adaptive play, (unperturbed) play still converges to a minimal curb set. Random perturbations of the best response dynamic identifies the stochastically stable states. In Young’s model of adaptive play with simple best-responses, the set of stochastically stable states are sensitive to the sample size that individuals from a population can draw. In generic games with higher order best-responders in both populations, the sample size is rendered irrelevant in determination of the stochastically stable set. Perhaps counter-intuitively, higher cognition may actually be bad for both the individual with higher cognition and his parent population."

This paper proposes to investigate the impact of financialization on energy markets (oil, gas, coal, and electricity European forward prices) during both normal times and periods of extreme fluctuation by using an original behavioral and emotional approach. With this aim, we propose a new theoretical and empirical framework based on a heterogeneous agents model in which fundamentalists and chartists co-exist and are subject to regret and uncertainty. We find significant evidence that energy markets are composed of heterogeneous traders who behave differently depending on the intensity of the price fluctuations and the uncertainty context. In particular, energy prices are governed primarily by fundamental and chartist agents that are neutral to uncertainty during normal times, whereas these prices face irrational chartist investors averse to uncertainty during periods of extreme fluctuations. In this context, the recent surge in energy prices can be viewed as the consequence of irrational exuberance. Our new theoretical model is suitable for modeling energy price dynamics and outperforms both the random walk and the ARMA model in out-of-sample predictive ability."

The results of the simulation demonstrate interactions between cognitive and social factors. For example, we show that cognitive capabilities and tendencies may be relevant to what social institutions may be adopted.

ChenChen2022OIfS,,Optimizing Incentives for Systems with Heterogeneous Agents,"Chen, Chen",2022,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This dissertation explores new models and applications based on the game theory of incentives. This exploration starts with controlling an invasive insect problem to address one of the most significant challenges facing our forests, the invasion of the Emerald ash borer (EAB), a non-native, wood-boring insect that threatens to kill most ash trees in North America, through designing two new cost-sharing programs between the landowners and local governments. Ash trees are one of North America’s most widely distributed tree genera and a vital part of the green infrastructure of cities, where they provide residents with numerous social, economic, and ecological benefits.Current strategies to slow ash mortality due to the EAB infestation include surveillance of ash tree health coupled with insecticide treatment and/or removal of infested trees. Most ash trees grow on private land, and the growing spread of EAB infestation is largely due to the lack of a private-public partnership in its control. Local governments need programs to induce landowners to undertake actions to slow ash mortality.A principal-agent modeling framework is presented to design two new programs in which a local government offers reimbursements to landowners to cover a portion of their management costs. Two mathematical models are designed for each program: one in which the reimbursement is based on the number of infested trees and another in which reimbursement is based on the number of treated trees. The numerical analysis shows that neither the optimal treatment decision nor the reimbursement in both programs is in general monotonic concerning the initial infestation level; rather, they depend on treatment effectiveness and the likelihood of the new infestations. Compared to the infestation-based reimbursement program, the treatment-based reimbursement program induces the landowner to treat more trees through a higher reimbursement and provides a higher overall benefit. The approach shown in this dissertation is expected to inspire other private-public partnerships to solve various environmental and societal spatio-temporal problems through better resource sharing, such as the management of water, land, and wildfire.Given the required reimbursement assigned to private lands, the government needs to address the problem of budget allocation among public and private sites. An integrated game theory-mixed integer framework is designed to allocate resources to the management decisions on both public and private sites over space and time to maximize the profit of the government. The attack rate of EAB of this integrated model is validated by predicting the real attack rate based on the real infestation EAB data.The dissertation then focuses on studying the implications of emissions policies in a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) system. The excessive emission of CO2 is supercharging the natural greenhouse effect, which causes the rise of temperature, further affects climate and sea levels, and even increases extreme weather and natural disasters. To induce emitters to capture as much as possible CO2, the principal-agent framework is designed between the CCS operator and emitters.Specifically, the principal (CCS operator) offers a menu of contracts to agents (emitters) whose demand may follow different distributions, and the government may or may not introduce the cap-and-trade policy (free allocated allowances given to emitters) into the market. Two scenarios are examined: 1) the cap-and-trade policy is launched, and 2) the cap-and-trade policy is not launched. The principal-agent framework is presented to design optimal contracts for emitters by the CCS operator. The principal prefers to offer efficient quantities to the agents regardless of the demand levels when there is only one type of agent with no carbon allowance assigned by the government; however, emitters are induced to capture all their emissions when the cap-and-trade policy is launched. When there are two different types of agents, mostly the emitters are induced to capture all their emissions with the allowance assigned by the government; however, they always do not have enough incentive to capture all emissions when the cap-and-trade policy is not implemented on the market."

Settlement expansion, the intensification of agricultural land-use practices, and farmland abandonment result in a decline of natural and semi-natural habitats and the related ecosystem services (ES). In this context, spatial planning has emerged as a key instrument for the management of ES provision. To better understand trade-offs and interactions between settlement growth and ES provision in a spatially explicit manner, we present a new modeling framework coupling an agent-based, agro-economic optimization model and a cellular-automata-based settlement growth model. The framework is applied in an inner alpine valley in the Valais, Switzerland, which experienced rapid settlement growth in recent years. Results demonstrate how the model framework allows support of local planning processes. Particularly cooperation among municipalities and an explicit consideration of ES can inform spatially explicit ES trade-off decisions under increasing demand for land. We conclude that better informed spatial planning processes support ES provision."

One of the most prominent examples is here the Minority Game (MG), which we address in some more detail. After a brief discussion of its basic setup and general phenomenology we summarise the main findings of the statistical mechanics analysis and discuss the emergence of stylised facts in extensions of the MG near their phase transitions between efficient and predictable regimes. We then turn towards more realistic variants which comprise heterogeneous populations of agents, with different memory capabilities, different inclinations to trade and varying expectations on the future evolution of the market. Finally we give a short outlook on potential future work in this area."

What could be the consequences at different scales in terms of social and economic development as well as nature conservation? Taking the heterogeneity of farms and farming systems in the region into account, are there farmers more prone to conversion and others that face greater obstacles? The objective of this paper is to shed light on some of these question by presenting the results of a scenario assessment carried out with regard to the extension of OF in the Camargue region in southern France. The application of different modelling approaches with great potential for the multi-scale and multi-criteria evaluation of the extension of OF is presented: bio-economic models, agent-based models and land-use/cover change models. According to our results, the most probable conversion in the near future in the Camargue would take place in fields with low salt pressure that belong to livestock breeders and diversified cereal producers. However, the regional conversion to OF is plausible since the region could maintain its economic productivity while decreasing potential harmful impacts on the environment. Finally, the possible conversion trajectories suggest that certain farmers (specialised in rice production) might need greater assistance to ensure such conversion to OF since their economic performance would be hampered during that period. The application of these three approaches to explore the same scenario in one region revealed their complementarity for tackling the complex issue of regional conversion to OF from different angles."

There has been no previous attempt to examine or synthesize these three models with respect to business-to-business (B2B) buying behavior. To fill this gap, this study reconceptualized these three models with B2B constructs using multi-cue settings and tested on B2B samples. This study aims to examine and estimate the relative impact of company- and country-specific images on B2B buyers’ evaluations of suppliers, and the direction of structural relationships with mediation among the constructs. Design/methodology/approach Data collection was administered through a web-based structured questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 276 purchasing managers. Structural equation modeling was used to test the study’s hypotheses. Findings Company image is significantly influenced by product country image (PCI) but not by overall CI. The existence of a significant relationship between PCI and perceived supplier performance in a multi-cue setting is an important new finding. In addition, company image significantly influences supplier performance and mediates the relationship between PCI and supplier performance. Among the three models that test structural relationships among CI and other constructs, the reconceptualized halo model fits the data best. Practical implications The study results revealed the contribution of company and country-related facets on B2B buyers’ perceptions of supplier performance while purchasing intermediate goods internationally. The significance of PCI on supplier performance emphasizes the strength of the industry sector within a country that may enable an industry to build a product-specific CI in international marketing. Originality/value This study advances the country-of-origin issue and debate concerning the strength of the country influence in the academic literature by addressing B2B buyers’ international purchasing behavior of intermediate goods. Additionally, the examination of multiple country facets, multi-cue settings and the CI influence structure in a single study, from a B2B perspective, offers a novel dimension to CI studies."

First, based on the ""small-world"" model of social networks, the environmental impacts of the U.S. book retail market is simulated using an agent-based modeling technique from a bottom-up perspective. The results show that the future book retail market is primarily dominated by the development of internet penetration. Energy use and carbon dioxide emissions for delivery can be reduced as much as 1.43 million cubic meters and 3.33 million tons, respectively, in the conservative scenario. More broadly, the framework and method used in this case can be easily adapted for studying environmental sustainability of other complex systems in which human components are the primary driver of environmental consequences. Second, the resilience of 2002 U.S. economy is studied by mapping the economic system as an economic input-output (EIO) network. Statistical analysis shows that the distributions of degree of nodes and weight of nodes (or links) of the EIO network generally follow a power law with fat tails in the logarithmic scale. The general power-law distribution suggests the economy's resilience against random failures occurring in nodes and links, while the fat tails in the logarithmic scale represent highly connected clusters consisting of strong nodes which enhance the EIO network's resilience against intentional attacks. More analysis on the network identifies critical sectors for the overall resilience of the economy, such as ""wholesale trade"", ""air transportation"", ""general state and local government services"", or ""motor vehicle parts manufacturing"". On the other hand, other sectors play less important roles in terms of resilience, such as ""veterinary services"", ""dental laboratories"", ""logging"", or ""fishing"". Furthermore, the analysis on dependence and similarity between sectors confirms sectors' role in the resilience of the EIO network. Finally, the quantitative tools developed in this research have a wide potential to apply to the evaluation of resilience for systems which contain numerous agents interacting with each other in complex ways."

These studies found dabigatran was generally cost-effective, considering well-accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, but estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) varied, even in the same setting. The objective of this study was to compare the findings of the published economic models and identify key model features accounting for differences. Methods All aspects of the economic evaluations were reviewed: model approach, inputs, and assumptions. A previously published model served as the reference model for comparisons of the selected studies in the US and UK settings. The reference model was adapted, wherever possible, using the inputs and key assumptions from each of the other published studies to determine if results could be reproduced in the reference model. Incremental total costs, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and ICERs (cost per QALY) were compared between each study and the corresponding adapted reference model. The impact of each modified variable or assumption was tracked separately. Results The selected studies were in the US setting (2), the Canadian setting (1), and the UK setting (2). All models used the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation study (RE-LY) as the main source for clinical inputs, and all used a Markov modelling approach, except one that used discrete event simulation. The reference model had been published in the Canadian and UK settings. In the UK setting, the reference model reported an ICER of UK£4,831, whereas the other UK-based analysis reported an ICER of UK£23,082. When the reference model was modified to use the same population characteristics, cost inputs, and utility inputs, it reproduced the results of the other model (ICER UK£25,518) reasonably well. Key reasons for the different results between the two models were the assumptions on the event utility decrement and costs associated with intracranial haemorrhage, as well as the costs of warfarin monitoring and disability following events. In the US setting, the reference model produced an ICER similar to the ICER from one of the US models (US$15,115/QALY versus US$12,386/QALY, respectively) when modelling assumptions and input values were transferred into the reference model. Key differences in results could be explained by the population characteristics (age and baseline stroke risk), utility assigned to events and specific treatments, adjustment of stroke and intracranial haemorrhage risk over time, and treatment discontinuation and switching. The reference model was able to replicate the QALY results, but not the cost results, reported by the other US cost-effectiveness analysis. The parameters driving the QALY results were utility values by disability levels as well as utilities assigned to specific treatments, and event and background mortality rates. Conclusions Despite differences in model designs and structures, it was mostly possible to replicate the results published by different authors and identify variables responsible for differences between ICERs using a reference model approach. This enables a better interpretation of published findings by focusing attention on the assumptions underlying the key model features accounting for differences."

Even though some strategies have been proposed by researchers, most of them can only work within a static negotiation environment. In this paper, we present a model for designing a strategy for agents that makes adjustable rates of concession by negotiating according to the changes of environments with uncertain and dynamic outside options. This proposal is based on the market-driven agents (MDAs) model, and is guided by four factors in order to determine the degree of concession. These factors are trading opportunity, trading competition, trading time and strategy, and eagerness. The contribution of this paper is extending the MDAs model to an open and dynamic negotiation environment by considering both the current and potential changes of the environment."

In the proposed model, trades are decided according to the market events in history combined with the forecast of market trends. The GDXP model employs a dynamic adjustment mechanism to make the bidding strategy adapt to the shocks in a dynamic environment. The experimental results of the comparison between GDXP and other typical models, with respect to both static and dynamic CDA markets, demonstrate the performance of the GDXP model."

In modelling this relationship we account for conditional variables as well as unobservable time and industry effects. A number of hypotheses are tested concerning heterogeneity in the impact of effective corporate tax rates on the size distributions of firms with regard to firm size class, industry and time. The results are based on data covering the whole Swedish economy for the period 1973–2002. The descriptive results suggest that effective corporate tax rates differ by firm size, industry and over time. Application of t-tests demonstrate inequality in mean and variance of effective corporate tax rates between major size classes but not within major size classes: smaller firms report a higher effective corporate tax rate than larger firms. The t-tests also demonstrate inequality in mean and variance of effective corporate tax rates between industrial sectors: service sector reports a higher effective corporate tax rate than production sector. The regressions show effective corporate tax rates to have: a negative effect on the size distribution of large firms, negative effect on transportation, financing and service sector and a positive effect on manufacturing, electricity and on production sector. We conclude that effective corporate tax rates affect the size distribution of firms as well as the composition of industries."

Basis for the financial valuation of an investment option is formed by simulating market dynamics with alternative price scenarios. The outputs include: investment strategies, derived as a function of the (uncertain) state vector of future market conditions and risk premium, calculated by contrasting the expected net present value for the optimal timing of the investment and the expected net present value of an immediate investment generation module of the BSAM, while both of these outputs are estimated for each available technology option.Findings - Different models make different assumptions shedding light upon different aspects of the socio-economic systems they attempt to analyze and hitherto, no such model succeeds in incorporating all the perceptions that are driving the integration of energy policies. BSAM is based on the notion that a convergence between policy evaluation and business strategy assessment models could be truly beneficial for regulators that aim to derive effective energy policies. Both the algorithm adopted and the structure of the modules of BSAM facilitate the analysis of complex interactions in a firm's decision making process, and even more the what-if analyses needed for alternative policy measure evaluation.Originality value - Setting the framework for a modelling approach that incorporates the role of risk-return perceptions of private actor's with diverse features, portfolio effects, path dependence and agent competition, into appraising energy and climate policies, and suggest that the heterogeneous world of investors requires reflexive assessment techniques. Above and beyond, understanding the drivers and triggers of firm's investment strategies will allow improving the effectiveness of energy policies."

Proceedings,,,1094-1099,,,Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE),Norcross,"Customers' expectations for fast, efficient, customized, and sustainable delivery services, together with governmental policies enforcing alignment to socio-economical standards, have raised challenges for delivery service providers in their effort to continuously improving their service levels and market share. Due to the wide range of decisions involved in parcel delivery systems, this phenomenon calls for a more holistic view over all involved parties for better capturing the inherent complexities in the interaction of individually made but collectively correlated decisions. Considering the large scale, high complexity, and fast dynamics of logistics in megacities, simulation tools play a crucial role in building such integrated platforms for assessing performance and enhancing operations in parcel delivery systems. This study introduces a discrete-event agent-based simulator platform developed by the Physical Internet Center of Georgia Tech to assess the holistic impact of novel approaches such as Physical Internet driven Multi-Tier Hyperconnected Mesh Networks on urban parcel logistics. The designed platform includes end-to-end players and various levels of strategic, tactical, and operational decisions on network design, vehicle and parcel routing, parcel consolidation, demand generation, service offering, customer choice modeling, and disruption management. We explain the concept, outline the framework and protocols for building this technology, and provide empirical results over daily transactions of a high-profile Chinese parcel delivery company, which lead us to discuss overall insights and introduce future research avenues."
LiJia2011Mhec,,Modeling household energy consumption and adoption of energy-efficient technology using recent micro-data,"Li, Jia",2011,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This study develops a unified technology choice and energy consumption model (a ""discrete/continuous model"") that can be applied to study household energy use behavior. The model, stemming from consumer theory, ensures modeling of consumer short-run energy demand and long-run capital investment decisions in a mutually consistent manner. The model adopts a second-order translog flexible functional form that allows considerable flexibility in the structure of consumer preferences and in the exploration of interplays among energy uses and between energy demand and appliance choices. This study extends the discrete/continuous model developed by Dubin and McFadden (1984) and is the first known application of the second-order translog flexible functional form in joint discrete/continuous modeling of consumer energy demand and appliance choice. Using a unique household-level dataset of 2,408 households served by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California, the model is applied to examine the roles of income, prices, household characteristics, and energy and environmental policy in household short-run energy use and long-run technology choices. The empirical analysis estimates a system of short-run household demand equations for electricity and natural gas and long-run technology choices with respect to clothes washing, water heating, space heating, and clothes drying. The results demonstrate the modeling framework is appropriate and robust in studying household energy use behavior. Findings from the empirical analysis have important implications for policy design. This study confirms two important market failures with respect to household energy technology choice behavior: the principal/agent problem and information imperfection. In the case of clothes washer choices, the voluntary, information-based Energy Star program emerges as the most significant factor influencing the adoption of energy-efficient front-loading clothes washers, followed by energy efficiency standards. Surprisingly, financial incentives, such as the popular rebate programs used to lower the initial capital cost of energy-efficient appliances, are found to be far less effective in influencing adoption of energy-efficient appliances. Furthermore, the study finds at the household level that the incentive for new technology adoption is greater under direct regulation than under market-based instruments, such as a carbon cap-and-trade program or emission taxes."

The Pitchford thesis contended that after the floating of the exchange rate the current account deficit was the residual outcome of rational optimizing decisions of private agents and if there was fiscal balance then the policy of targeting the reduction of the current account deficit based on the KMF paradigm was misconceived. Empirical tests based on the application of the net present value criterion using vector autoregressions, unit root and cointegration econometrics reveals that Australia's current account deficit revealed that the current account deficits were unsustainable during the fixed exchange period and over the whole study period 1960q3–2007q4, but not during the floating exchange rate period post-1983q4. Therefore the empirical results gave credibility to the Pitchford thesis but Australian policymakers continued to target the reduction of the current account deficit because their failure to make the paradigm shift from KMF to ITO to be consistent with the regime shift from a fixed to a floating exchange rate. However, in 2004 after more than two decades feuding Australian policymakers accepted the Pitchford thesis and abandon the policy of targeting the reduction of the current account deficit. But the global financial crisis and global recession has delivered a death blow to the Pitchford thesis by undermining the key assumptions of fiscal balance and rationality that underpins it. The fiscal stimulus package that has been implemented to combat the fall in aggregate demand and restore consumer confidence due to the global recession has resulted in massive fiscal imbalance and the credit crunch has undermined rational behavior and consumer confidence. Therefore, the Pitchford thesis no longer rules the policy roost after the global financial crisis. In this study we draw on the conflicting policy perspectives on the unsustainability of high US current account deficits that tender a malign prognosis based on Salvatore's twin deficit hypothesis and a benign prognosis based on Bernanke's global savings glut hypothesis to identify some key policy challenges that confront Australian policymakers to navigate the Australian economy out of the global financial crisis and recession into a robust recovery phase in the near future."

First, each term is explained and the advantages and limitations of its aspect is discussed. Then, the nature of combinations between each pair and literature on the previous studies are given. Several cases were investigated and results were magnified in order to conclude with the applicability and combination of GIS- Game Theory- Water Resources Management. It is concluded that the game theory is used relatively in limited studies of water management fields such as cost/benefit allocation among users, water allocation among trans-boundary users in water resources, water quality management, groundwater management, analysis of water policies, fair allocation of water resources development cost and some other narrow fields. Also, Decision-making in environmental projects requires consideration of trade-offs between socio-political, environmental, and economic impacts and is often complicated by various stakeholder views. Most of the literature on water allocation and conflict problems uses traditional optimization models to identify the most efficient scheme while the Game Theory, as an optimization method, combined GIS are beneficial platforms for agent based models to be used in solving Water Resources Management problems in the further studies."

An agent auctions a large basket of transactions in several stocks to brokers who do not know the individual stock names, but only some generic characteristics of the basket. The client delivers this large amount of sales and purchases to the winning broker who has to simultaneously trade the basket for a fixed commission fee. The commission is paid on the basis of the winning bid at the auction, usually submitted as cents per share. This study provides a new model, based on large deviations (LD) approximation results, that may facilitate brokers to formulate their bids.

In the context of the European Maastricht, the European countries face public receipts shortage and to focus in the management of the tax agencies in order to maximize receipts. The procedure adopted in this paper allows benchmarking the tax agencies accurately.Design methodology approach - The paper adopts the stochastic frontier model to benchmark the tax offices. This model is presently very popular in benchmarking exercises, based on its statistical framework.Findings - The paper finds that the tax offices analysed vary along the sample and along the period.Research limitations implications - The homogeneity of the tax offices and the short data set are the main limitations of the paper. Relative to the first, since they are managed by the same entity and perform the same task we can claim that they are similar, relative to the second critic, we cannot overcome it because of the secrecy related to this units.Practical implication - The efficiency rankings are due to the way the tax offices handle costs and outputs. The way they handle the combination of output and inputs is explained in the literature by the principal-agent relationship, by collective-action problem, due to asymmetric information between different tax offices and X-inefficiency. The public policy has to address these problems in order to upgrade the efficiency of the tax offices.Originality value - This is the first paper adopting the stochastic frontier model in tax offices."

Yet there is no consensus over what constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism that induces agents or managers to consistently act in the interest of share value optimisation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to resolve an on-going issue in financial economics: how can CEOs be effectively monitored by the board of directors? Design/methodology/approach - A survey of the literature on corporate governance and the relationship between board composition and financial performance leads to the development of the proposed model, which is based on a framework which takes into account the probability of success representing a CEO's ability, and the active monitoring function (which is represented by the numbers of control visits) carried-out by the directors. Findings - The design of the model is aimed at identifying an optimal level of monitoring, which will maximise share value, to guide internal and independent directors. Research limitations/implications - The model has limitations: it does not address the input of other directors and it focuses solely on the monitoring function, even though boards also play important roles in providing information and advice to management. Originality/value - The finding of this study contributes to the Agency Theory debate, in essence that the board monitoring of CEO will improve the performance of the CEO and avoid possible conflict of interests."

Failure may result in huge economic loses and damage to company reputation. Risk assessment usually involves quantitative and qualitative decisions. The purpose of this paper is to apply fuzzy logic to capture and inference qualitative decisions made in the House of Risk (HOR) assessment method. Design/methodology/approach In the existing HOR model, aggregate risk potential (ARP) is calculated by the risk event times the risk agent value and its occurrence. However, these values are usually obtained from interviews, which may involve subjective decisions. To overcome this shortcoming, a fuzzy-based approach is proposed to calculate ARP instead of the current deterministic approach. Findings Risk analyses are conducted in five major categories of risk sources: internal, global environment, supplier, customer and third-party logistics provider. Moreover, each category is further divided into different sub-categories. The results indicate that the fuzzy-based HOR successfully inferences the inputs of the risk event, risk agents and its occurrence, and can prioritize the risk agents in order to take proactive decisions. Practical implications The proposed fuzzy-based HOR model can be used practically by manufacturers in the global supply chain. It provides a framework for decision makers to systematically analyze the potential risks in different categories. Originality/value The proposed fuzzy-based HOR approach improves the traditional approach by more precise modeling of the qualitative decision-making process. It contributes to a more accurate reflection of the real situation that manufacturers are facing."
GeJ2023Mutw,,Modelling urban transition with coupled housing and labour markets,"Ge, J and Furtado, B.A",2023,,,,,,,SAGE,,"This study develops an agent-based model of urban transition, U-TRANS, with coupled housing and labour markets to simulate the transition of a city during a major industrial shift. We propose a dynamic, bottom-up framework incorporating the key interacting factors and micro mechanisms that drive the transition paths of cities. Using U-TRANS, we simulate a number of distinctive urban transition paths, from total collapse to weak recovery to enhanced training to global recruit, and analyse the resulting outcomes on economic growth, employment, inequality, housing price and the local neighbourhoods. We find that poor neighbourhoods benefit the most from growth in the new industry, whereas rich neighbourhoods do better than the rest when growth stagnates and the city declines. We also find there is a subtle trade-off between growth and equality in development strategy. By aggressively recruiting a large number of skilled workers from outside of the city in a short time, the division between local and non-local workers can be widened. The study contributes to the understanding of the dynamic process and micro mechanisms underlying urban transition. It helps explain why some cities starting from seemingly similar initial conditions may go on divergent development paths at critical moments in the history. It also demonstrates the heterogeneous impact of industrial shift on different urban neighbourhoods. The model can be used as a policy testbed for different development strategies to help cities navigate through a major industrial revolution."
VriendNicolaasJ.2002WHaA,,Was Hayek an Ace?,"Vriend, Nicolaas J.",2002,Southern economic journal,68,4,811-840,,,Southern Economic Association,Stillwater,"To address the question whether Hayek might have been an agent-based computational economist (ACE) avant-la-lettre, I consider an ACE model concerning the phenomenon of information contagion. Alongside increasing returns, network externalities, and information cascades, information contagion has been presented in the literature as an explanation for particular patterns of macrobehavior that may seem at odds with the underlying micromotives. Whereas these other explanations have been shown to have a proper microfoundation, information contagion has remained a phenomenon that seemed to occur only when certain ad hoc rules of thumb for individual behavior are assumed. I show how information-contagious behavior can emerge in a coevolutionary process of interacting adaptive agents, how this is related to various Hayekian themes, and how ACE research in general can be seen as an application of Hayek's methodological insights."
GrandaCatalina2020OtAI,,On the Aggregate Implications of Removing Barriers to Formality,"Granda, Catalina and Hamann, Franz",2020,Review - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,102,2,203-220,,,Federal Reserve Bank St Louis,ST LOUIS,"This article examines the aggregate implications of several policies aimed at removing barriers to formality. To this end, we build a dynamic equilibrium model in which heterogeneous agents choose to work for a wage or operate a technology in the formal or informal sector, based on the costs and benefits associated with these occupational choices. Formality entails compliance with taxes, a minimum wage scheme, and firm operation costs but has a productivity advantage stemming from access to external finance and legal enforcement mechanisms. Informal activities avoid taxes and regulations without detection or punishment. The simulation results suggest that eliminating formal operation fees leads to firm formalization, earnings redistribution, and increases in total factor productivity and welfare. In addition, eliminating the income tax reduces labor informality. These two policies, taken together, generate full formalization and gains in redistribution, efficiency, and welfare that are even greater than when all the barriers to formality are jointly removed. In contrast, eliminating the minimum wage has strong adverse effects on labor formalization and little impact on productivity. Eliminating the payroll tax leaves the occupational composition nearly unchanged and productivity and welfare as well."

Cooperative transactions require peer-to-peer protocols based on inter-agent communication. In this paper, we develop a cooperative multi-agent transaction model that includes peer-to-peer protocols for commit control and failure recovery. The significance and feasibility of this approach have been demonstrated in a prototype implemented at HP Labs, using our dynamic agent infrastructure."
KlingenbergB2006Oorp,,Optimization of residential property management,"Klingenberg, B and Brown, R.J",2006,Property management,24,4,397-414,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose - The paper aims to provide an analysis of the principle-agent relationship between owner (principal) and manager (agent) of investment properties by: developing an optimization model for the net profit scenario that any third party manager of properties in multiple locations faces; and describing the principal's (or owner's) problem and likewise developing an income optimization model. The model allows illustrating the misalignment of incentives and compensation arrangements common to the business of managing small investment properties.Design methodology approach - The paper provides an in depth review of literature on the agency problem, both in general as well as in real estate research and compares the qualitative findings with analytical results provided by the model. The latter is developed by applying a transaction cost framework to the context of income structures in investment properties and their management.Findings - The optimization model shows that profit maximization for the manger (agent) depends on an optimum number of properties to be managed. It is further shown that the compensation methods customary in small real estate management contracts are inappropriate for the manager to control and cover the transaction costs, which result from the fact that more than one location is managed. The result is a kind of impossibility theorem, stating that management of small investment properties based on customary compensation structures is unprofitable as the number of properties and their distance rises.Practical implications - The analysis shows that industry practice for the compensation of management of small investment properties does not address the inherent principle-agent problem. Consequently, additional compensation and incentive mechanisms as well as control structures need to be employed by the owner. The paper, therefore, provides a starting point to review and improve industry practice.Originality value - The paper expands the existing literature of the agency problem in real estate by providing an optimization model for management of investment properties. The model and findings are of interest to academics for its analytical treatment of agency relationships; as well as to practitioners, as the analysis reveals inefficiencies in industry practice."

Design/methodology/approach A scenario-based online survey was conducted with existing and potential luxury hotel guests. The relationships among TTF, LTF, value enhancement, satisfaction and loyalty were examined using partial least square structural equation modeling. Moreover, the respondents were asked their preferred service agent (human staff vs technology) in a luxury hotel to further understand luxury hotel guests’ perception toward technological services in a luxury hotel setting. Findings The results reveal that both TTF and LTF have significant impacts on the luxury hotel’s value enhancement, and the impacts of TTF and LTF on value enhancement are moderated by the guests’ technology optimism. The findings of this study suggest that the luxury hotel brands must consider the fit between the image of their brand and the technology to increase guests’ perceived value enhancement, satisfaction and loyalty. Research limitations/implications Applying categorization theory, this study extended the concept of brand extension to technology implementation. The findings advance the current understanding of how technology affects luxury hotel consumers’ perceived value enhancement, and how consumers’ optimism influences the impacts of TTF and LTF on value enhancement. Practical implications By examining the effects of TTF and LTF on luxury hotel guests’ perceived value enhancement, this study would shed light on luxury hotel brands’ technology implementation strategies. By understanding how TTF and LTF affect consumers’ perceived value enhancement, luxury hotel brands will be able to better design their technology implementation plans. Originality/value Even though luxury hotel brands are well known for offering high-level and personalized services through interpersonal interactions between employees and consumers, they have been actively implementing a variety of technologies to enhance guest experience and satisfaction. This study investigates the role of technological innovations in a luxury hotel setting. Particularly, this study examines how technologies improve guests’ perceived value of a luxury hotel and lead to satisfaction and loyalty."
JohnsonJustinAndrew2014Ge,,Geospatial economics,"Johnson, Justin Andrew",2014,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Understanding how economic systems interact with ecosystems requires models that include geospatial heterogeneity. Integration of economic and ecological systems is vital for sustainable development, especially with respect to climate change, food security and the management of common property resources. Advances in remote sensing and geographic information systems have created a wealth of data applicable to economics, but it is challenging to incorporate high-resolution, global data in existing economic models. In this thesis, I integrate geospatial data with economic theory to analyze important environmental problems. The next three chapters describe the techniques I use for modeling geospatially-explicit economic systems and apply them to current environmental challenges. Chapter one addresses the tradeoffs between food production and environmental protection. I address the question of how we can optimally feed a growing population (requiring a 100% increase in calorie production by 2050) while minimizing the loss of carbon storage (which is important for mitigating climate change). I use high-resolution, gridded global data to give geospatial specificity to the results of the optimization. The framework I present in this chapter includes only one production choice and one environmental good, but it is more broadly applicable to multiple goods and multiple ecosystem services. This chapter also shows how using geospatial data can increase the policy relevance of an analysis. For example, instead of claiming that tropical forests are in general very valuable, using geospatial data allows for the more precise claim that this specific 10 kilometer patch of forest is better kept as forest than cultivated. Spatially explicit information like this can help construct more specific policies, such as food-for-carbon swaps or identifying which parcels ought to be protected first given a limited conservation budget. Chapter two presents a microeconomic model of spatial foraging that addresses how humans gather goods on a spatially heterogeneous landscape when transport costs are non-negligible. The general problem of foraging arises when multiple agents located in space compete for resources that are characterized by their location. I use agent-based simulation methods to account for agents that must move over the landscape subject to terrain and road networks, depletion by rival agents and spatial heterogeneity with a large number of agents (10 million). The model is applicable to several topics in environmental economics, including fuelwood collection and fisheries management, but also more general economic topics such as housing, employment search, transportation, pollution and urban economics. Another contribution of chapter two is that it makes several methodological advances that allow for spatially-explicit agent-based simulation on extremely large systems. These advances are of two types: first, I present data creation methods that allow for high resolution data to be created globally, relying on satellite-derived data products and spatial downscaling techniques to estimate environmental and social indicators, such as population density or spatially defined wages. Second, I identify computational methods (and implement them in a software application) that allows for fast calculation of agent interactions and movement of space. I discuss the data storage types necessary for this along with a method of vectorizing the calculations to enable computation of extremely large systems (with as many as 10 billion agents). Chapter two concludes an application of the spatial foraging model in which I assess how villagers in Tanzania gather firewood from forests. Firewood collection is a useful example because the need for a spatially explicit model is clear. Transportation costs of firewood are very high relative to their value and firewood in almost always collected by agents foraging for their own consumption. For instance, Fabe and Grote (2013) report that 97.5% of household in Tanzania use firewood as their main fuel, but only 13% of firewood is purchased. I define behavior rules in the simulation based on a microeconomic agricultural household production model (Singh et al. 1986, Bardhan and Udry 1999) apply them to high-resolution geospatial data for Tanzania. I iteratively simulate individual agents' foraging actions and observe the value of firewood obtained. The estimates obtained from this method match existing estimates of firewood collection while providing more detail about where the firewood is collected. The empirical application presented in chapter two is useful to practitioners of ecosystem serve estimation. Calculating the ecosystem service value of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been difficult in practice due to computational and theoretical problems. Existing estimation approaches identify the abundance of NTFPs on different forest types but do not explicitly state how agents gather the firewood. The approach I use accounts for how these gathering decisions interact with the abundance of NTFPs to determine the ecosystem service value. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)"

Our objective is to discuss the modelling gaps and opportunities to advance the science for multisector adaptation and tradeoffs. We focus on power system operational models, which typically represent key physical and economic aspects of grid operations over days to a year and assume a fixed power grid infrastructure. Due to computational burden, models are typically customized to reflect regional resource opportunities, data availability, and applications of interest. While there are model intercomparison papers, there is however no model-agnostic characterization and systematic overview of the state-of-the-art process representations in operational power system models. To address our objective, we conceptualize power system operational models with four core processes: physical grid assets (generation, transmission, loads, and storage), model objectives and purpose, institutions and decision agents, and performance metrics. We taxonomize the representations of these core processes based on a review of 23 existing open-source and commercial models. As we acknowledge the computational burden of certain representations, we leverage this taxonomy to describe tradeoffs in process fidelity and tractability that have been adopted by the research community to address interactions between the power grid and hydrometeorological uncertainties, global change, and/or technological innovation. The core process taxonomy along with the existing computational tradeoffs are used to identify technical gaps and recommend future model development needs and research directions to better represent power grid operations as part of integrated multisector dynamics modeling and interdisciplinary research."

However, most of the literature on time-varying beta is motivated by econometric estimation using various latent risk factors rather than explicit modelling of the stochastic behaviour of betas through agents’ behaviour, such as momentum trading. Misspecification of beta risk and the lack of any theoretical guidance on how to specify risk factors based on the representative agent economy appear empirically challenging. In this paper, we set up a dynamic equilibrium model of a financial market with boundedly rational and heterogeneous agents within the mean-variance framework of repeated one-period optimisation and develop an explicit dynamic behaviour CAPM relation between the expected equilibrium returns and time-varying betas. By incorporating the two most commonly used types of investors, fundamentalists and chartists, into the model, we show that there is a systematic change in the market portfolio, risk-return relationships, and time varying betas when investors change their behaviour, such as the chartists acting as momentum traders. In particular, we demonstrate the stochastic nature of time-varying betas. We also show that the commonly used rolling window estimates of time-varying betas may not be consistent with the ex-ante betas implied by the equilibrium model. The results provide a number of insights into an understanding of time-varying beta."

We take Guanxi as an exogenous implicit contract and employ a standard principal-agent contract to deal with the interest conflicts based on explicit project performance to build a principal-agent model where the principal (the owner or sponsor) chooses a Guanxi action and an endogenous contract based on explicit (synthesized) project performance to stimulate the agent (the manager). The results show that conditioned on the optimal explicit principal-agent contract, the principalpsilas maintaining the Guanxi elicits higher efforts by the agent and then higher project performance is to be achieved, but whether the principal maintains the Guanxi depends on the trade-off between Guanxi action cost and extra Guanxi benefit and is irrelevant to how that benefit is distributed between the principal and the agent."

The focus is on systems in which multiple agent classes with different qualifications serve multiple customer classes with different needs. We assume that customers are impatient, abandon if they have to wait, and that they may retry. A discrete-time modeling approach is used to capture the dynamics of the system due to time-dependent arrival rates. Staffing levels and shift schedules are simultaneously optimized over a set of different approximate realizations of the underlying stochastic processes to consider the randomness of the system. The numerical results indicate that the presented approach works best for medium-sized and large contact centers with skills-based routing of customers for which stochastic queueing models are rarely applicable."

This study examines this global viability at a lower level, i.e., as a result of the combination of idiosyncratic traits and activities of heterogeneous agents at the individual level. A multi-agent simulation model of the small-scale fishery sector in Senegal is presented to explore this approach. The aim of the study is to formalize diverse interaction sets between agents at the near individual level (communities) and evaluate their effect on the overall function and possible coordination of the fishery sector. Diverse sets of fishermen, traders, boats, trucks, consumers, fishing zones, markets, landing sites and fish products are formalized based on observations reported from the real sector. The model produces contrasted patterns and histories from one place (port, market) to another. Simulations show that at the integrated level, the fishery system may reach a homeostatic state by itself, where production, wealth, working population size and activity are stable and optimally organized (four indicators are presented in this respect). The homeostatic, steady regime of the simulated system can be deteriorated (e.g., when removing the entry/exit of working communities). The overall viability obtained by simulation is discussed. The role of self-adaptation, diversity, and history in the synchronization and good function of the integrated fishery system is highlighted."

The role of gender differences,"Ettis, Saïd Aboubaker",2022,Gender in management,37,1,108-125,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,Leeds,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent to which personal values affect entrepreneurial intentions and the extent to which this relationship depends on gender among the millennial generation. Design/methodology/approach This relationship was examined using the list of values (LOV). Based on a sample of 600 respondents born between 1977 and 1994, a self-administered online questionnaire was conducted. Findings The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach demonstrated that Generation Y members who give higher priority to self-direction, social affiliation and hedonic orientation values have greater entrepreneurial intentions. Across gender, the PLS-multigroup analysis (MGA) approach reveals that self-direction values enhance entrepreneurial intention for Generation Y females but not for males. Social affiliation values improve entrepreneurial intention for Generation Y males but not for females. Hedonic orientation values rise entrepreneurial intentions for both Generation Y males and females similarly. The findings give also a ranking of the nine LOV. Research limitations/implications Across-cultural comparisons are lacking in this research. This study only focuses on the value–intention relationship. Future research could study the value–attitude–behavior. Practical implications The results provide implications to all agents concerned by promoting new enterprises and feminine entrepreneurship regarding the implementation of personal values in fostering the venture creation process and stimulation of people to become business owners. Originality/value Little is known about the role of personal values in venture creation. The findings provide support for the role personal values play in building entrepreneurial intentions. The focus here was on Generation Y. The generation that faces problems of unemployment, job loss and poverty specifically in the time of crises of the COVID-19 pandemic. The value-based entrepreneurship approach is a proliferating field of research as the world seeks to rebuild economies."
KlingenbergBeate2008Rcre,,Rent control revisited: effects on property management,"Klingenberg, Beate and Brown, Roger J",2008,Property management,26,1,56-65,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how an optimization model previously published by the authors is employed to study the effects of rent control on income optimization for the owner and the manager, as well as on the principal-agent relationship. The model explains effects on management, maintenance and housing quality observed under rent control.Design methodology approach - The optimization model is developed by applying a transaction cost framework to the context of income structures in investment properties and their management. Rent control is introduced into the model as a rent maximum.Findings - Under rent control, the manager is forced to optimize income solely through cost control, without motivation to provide above minimum services. The owner is unable to optimize income. Income and funds available for management and maintenance are reduced by costs uncontrollable by the owner. Consequently, management and maintenance are reduced, if not eliminated, resulting in deterioration of the housing stock, notwithstanding minimum habitability standards imposed by regulators. This dilemma argues against dropping management entirely and interferes with the owner's quest to find the right incentive structure for the agent.Research limitations implications - Rent control is modeled as a cap on rents. Many rent control policies employ a maximum in rent increase instead, with the maximum often linked to inflation. As the results of the model are in line with real-world observations, this simplification seems to be non-critical.Practical implications - Rent control was implemented with the intent to provide affordable housing to the less fortunate in society. Economic and social effects of rent control have since been heatedly discussed, in the public arena and in academia. This paper supports the view that rent control has unintended, negative consequences not only for the property owner, but also for the property manager (who is at the brink of elimination) and for the tenant (as housing quality deteriorates). This paper therefore encourages a renewed discussion and review of rent control policies.Originality value - The paper expands existing literature by analyzing the effects of rent control on property management. By using an optimization model, theory-based results are provided that supplements real-word observations, which is interesting for both academics and practitioners. Furthermore, the applicability of the previously developed optimization model is strengthened."

In this paper we study utilities which are bounded below, which necessitates novel modelling elements to prevent the question becoming trivial. What we propose is that an agent is subjected to random reviews of his finances. If he is reviewed and found to be bankrupt, then he is thrown into jail, and receives some large but finite negative value. In such a framework, we find optimal investment and consumption behaviour very different from the standard story. As the agent’s wealth goes negative, he gradually abandons hope of ever becoming honest again, and plunders as much as he can before being caught. Agents with very high wealth act like standard Merton investors."

However, non-product-specific attitudes to a COO, including the notion of animosity, have received rather less attention. This paper aims to investigate COO as a multi-dimensional construct and animosity as a normative dimension of buyers’ attitudes and intentions. Design/methodology/approach The work is based on data collected from industrial buyers in Egypt and Canada to enable a comparative perspective between developing and developed countries. Structural equation modeling was used to test the study’s hypotheses. Findings Country of manufacture was an antecedent of perceived quality and a determinant of brand evaluation in both countries. Price was an antecedent of perceived risk and value in Egypt, while its impact on perceived risk was less pronounced in Canada. Perceived value was the strongest determinant of willingness to buy, while animosity played a significant role in this respect in Canada but not in Egypt. Research limitations/implications Country of brand was not included as a dimension to be investigated; industry type was not controlled and may confound the results; and generalization of the results is limited given the cross-sectional approach. Originality/value The study’s contribution lies in four main elements, viewed individually and in combination: investigating a large number of COO constructs that have not been studied within a single research context in B2B before; including the animosity construct in a B2B setting; contrasting “benefit received” and “sacrifice given” constructs that help to shape industrial buyers’ purchase decisions; and carrying out the research in two very different countries to help improve the generalizability of results."

This paper reviews some of the main developments in this literature. It offers a critical appraisal of its contributions to date and discusses potential pitfalls of taking a pure NOEM approach by dismissing work not based in explicit utility maximization as ""ad hoc.'' The paper proposes broadening the NOEM literature to include consideration of heterogeneities within and across open economies. In light of the complexities involved in modeling heterogeneous agents or structures, the field of open economy macroeconomics may stand to gain from the pursuit of an impure NOEM. Work along these lines would de-emphasize dynamics, general equilibrium, and explicit optimization in favor of a focus on the true innovation of the NOEM literature, which has been highlighting the crucial importance of accounting for imperfect competition and price and wage rigidities in macroeconomic theories of open economies."
ButtleD2005Cnaa,,Credit networks and agent games,"Buttle, D",2005,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This thesis is divided into three parts; an intensity based network model of firm default, an agent based network model of firm default, and an agent based model of feedback effects from dynamic hedging. The common theme among all three parts is the application of ideas from both physics and mathematics to the solution of problems motivated by the financial markets. Less broadly, in the first two parts, the common themes are credit markets, networks, and dependent defaults. Part one tackles the problem of default dependence from a probabilistic perspective, modelling the default of companies as generalised Poisson processes, with the default dependence structure given by a network. We present a mathematical framework to solve a generalised version of the Jarrow Yu model of looping defaults and study the relationship between network structure and the resilience of a network of firms to default events. Using this model we then show how to price simple multi-name credit products such as kth to default baskets. Part two again considers dependent defaults, but here the network is dynamic and firms are modelled as simple agents, defined by strategies, whose interactions determine a network of trading links. Using our agent based network model of firm default we study network structure and their degree distributions, firm lifetimes, and look for evidence of agent learning and default clustering. We then study the effect of default on a network of firms and the response of remaining firms to that default event. Part three considers a relatively more established agent based framework, called the Minority Game. We first describe in detail the Minority Game and discuss its suitability as a market model. We then show how it may be applied to modelling the actions of traders delta hedging a short option position. We show that for a variety of option positions, in a sufficiently illiquid market feedback effects arise from the actions of the traders as their trades impact upon the underlying market."
GabrieliTommaso2008Rpuo,,Redistributive politics under optimally incomplete information,"Gabrieli, Tommaso",2008,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This thesis wants to contribute to the understanding of the role of collective beliefs and incomplete information in the analysis of the dynamics of inequality, growth and redistributive politics. Extensive evidence shows that the difference in the political support for redistribution appears to reflect a difference in the social perceptions regarding the determinants of individual wealth and the underlying sources of income inequality. The thesis presents a theoretical framework of beliefs and redistribution which explains this evidence through multiple politico-economic equilibria. Differently from the recent literature which obtains multiple equilibria by modeling agents characterized by psychological biases, my framework is based on standard assumptions. Multiple equilibria originate from multiple welfare maximizing levels of information for the society. Multiplewelfare-maximizing levels of information exist because increasing the informativeness of an economy produces a trade-off between a decrease in adverse selection and an increase in moral hazard. The framework provides a new micro-foundation of incomplete information as an institutional feature and answers various macroeconomic policy questions with different models."

Because governments, businesses, and consumers are economic agents, this study examined the effects of governmental (privacy legislations) and firm-related (online business brand image) factors on consumer perceptions of online privacy risk. This paper proposes a conceptual model for exploring the underlying mechanisms of privacy legislations and online business brand image on consumer perceptions of online privacy risk. To test the conceptual model, data were collected from 425 students on a university campus which provided real personal information to online businesses within the preceding 3 months. Structural equation modeling was employed to test all the hypotheses in the conceptual model. The results reveal that perceived effectiveness of privacy legislations and online business brand image positively affect trust in online businesses. In addition, trust in online businesses positively affects perceived effectiveness of business privacy policies and perceived benefits of information disclosure, which in turn negatively influences online privacy risk perception."

Indian consumers attract global players due to untapped potential and favorable policy measures initiated for higher foreign direct investments. The purpose of this paper is to understand the prevailing level of service quality as perceived by insurance customers in India in the presence of certain contextual antecedents and moderators. Design/methodology/approach Perceptions about constructs like customer risk dispositions, awareness, past experiences, customer involvement, choice overload, service quality and satisfaction of 256 customers were collected using a questionnaire survey. A variance-based structural equation modeling helped to identify significant linkages among the constructs. Findings In order to assess service quality levels, a 15-item scale having the infrastructure, employees, agents and product dimensions was found valid and reliable. Choice overload and customer involvement were found to moderate the influence of antecedents and service quality, respectively. The influence of choice overload on quality perceptions is insignificant. The study concludes that the existing risk beliefs are insufficient, and experiences have less predictive contribution to quality perceptions. Research limitations/implications Theoretically, this study examined the process of satisfaction development from service quality perceptions. This study offers insights for developing theories to portray future consumer behavior where more dependence of self-service technologies is expected to dominate service delivery mechanisms in insurance. The study informs that general insurance customers in India prefer more diversified products, more customer-centric employees/agents and better technical quality. Practical implications The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the prevailing insurance consumer behavior in the general insurance sector of India and help insurance service providers in streamlining their strategies for better insurance penetration and reduced lapse rate.

Much of the legislation governing financial products and financial services is based on the classical view that economic agents, including consumers, are essentially selfish by nature, seeking to maximise their personal financial benefit, by acting in a rational manner and through making independent choices. Of course, nobody pretends that this view is an accurate reflection of the economy, and even less so an accurate portrayal of human beings. Yet this forms the standard profile for modelling and thus the basis for assumptions which underpin much of the regulation governing the economy."
CirilloCinzia2012AMoW,,A Model of Weekly Labor Participation for a Belgian Synthetic Population,"Cirillo, Cinzia and Cornelis, Eric and Toint, Philippe L.",2012,Networks and spatial economics,12,1,59-73,,,Springer US,Boston,"This paper presents a model of labor participation calibrated on a weekly basis; part-time and full-time employments are also considered. By applying the theory of random utility maximization we model households’ choices. In order to have a good temporal and spatial coverage the model is calibrated on three datasets, extracted from both national and regional travel surveys. The results are applied to synthetic households that reproduce the Belgian population. The proposed innovative methodology simulates synthetic agents by accounting both for households’ and individuals’ characteristics, while not suffering from the problem of the “zero cell value”. The results indicate that there is major day-to-day variability in working activity participation; in particular, on Wednesdays and Fridays the number of households working part-time or not working is particularly high. This is consistent with what was expected by the analysts. Working participation is a fundamental component in activity based models where work is considered a skeletal activity. The tools developed here can be useful to study how changes in population characteristics (i.e. increases of flexible working arrangements and of the number of women in the work force) affect activity participation and travel patterns."

Careful analysis helps organizations operate more effectively, whether they're manufacturing products, providing health care, or running a fleet of delivery trucks, and this is done day in and day out. Yet nations will go to war, or launch a major humanitarian relief effort, or intervene in the existence of some neighboring state without any comparable quantitative analysis, and often pay dearly for it, whether in actual monetary costs, loss of life, failure to save lives, damaged international relationships, or any combination of these. U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq are but two glaring examples of interventions that lacked careful quantitative analysis, and both are widely viewed as badly flawed, if not outright failures. Understanding the potential impact of any action is critical to the success of that action, and in ESTIMATING IMPACT: A Handbook of Computational Methods and Models for Anticipating Economic, Social, Political and Security Effects in International Interventions Alexander Kott and Gary Citrenbaum, with a stellar group of contributors, demonstrate how military or humanitarian interventions (or the decision not to intervene) can be rigorously analyzed beforehand and their likely impacts and ramifications predicted at levels appropriate to their scope. A wide range of modeling programs are available that support plan assessment and impact forecast, and they allow accurate prediction within an interdependent set of political, military, economic, social, information, and infrastructure systems, and experts involved in the use and development of these tools demonstrate how, when, and why they should be used. Additionally, visualization tools, data mining tools, and manipulation tools are discussed that support model population and operations monitoring, along with considerations of what is still needed to help this stunningly practical use of decision science technologies advance even further. This is essential reading for the entire OR/MS and Computer Science community involved in researching and developing these tools, the entire government, military, and policy community involved in making the decisions behind intervention, and the entire business community looking for strong analytical tools that can be applied to their own domains of activity."

Based on the assumption that service systems face complex conditions, the paper posits that systems thinking may support the understanding of key issues in service management.Design methodology approach - This paper proposes an interpretation of complexity in the context of service systems, which highlights the perspective change that occurs when a systems approach is adopted. The offered conceptual perspective is then brought to an operational level, in spite of the complexity of the decisions driving a viable system, by modelling a service system as a network of agents, resources, processes and decisions through the use of fuzzy logic. The paper reviews service management research streams, and takes a deeper look at the concepts of service systems and complex service systems. The paper then proceeds to discuss how systems thinking contributes to service management by proposing a systems interpretation of complexity.Findings - Service management theories and models may be enhanced by integrating prevailing approaches, based on a quantitative and mechanistic view of service systems dynamics, with systems thinking-based meta-models that can be used in better understanding service exchanges. The findings of the paper also show how the integration of an engineering approach can be insightful to the understanding of service systems; adopting a Viable Systems Approach (VSA) as a meta-model can be useful in fully comprehending market behaviour in uncertain conditions.Originality value - The originality of this paper lies in exploring the contribution of systems thinking, in particular of the Viable Systems Approach (VSA), to service management and decision making."
GershkovAlex2014DAaP,,Dynamic Allocation and Pricing: A Mechanism Design Approach,"Gershkov, Alex and Moldovanu, Benny",2014,,9,,,,,The MIT Press,Cambridge,"Dynamic allocation and pricing problems occur in numerous frameworks, including the pricing of seasonal goods in retail, the allocation of a fixed inventory in a given period of time, and the assignment of personnel to incoming tasks. Although most of these problems deal with issues treated in the mechanism design literature, the modern revenue management (RM) literature focuses instead on analyzing properties of restricted classes of allocation and pricing schemes. In this book, Alex Gershkov and Benny Moldovanu propose an approach to optimal allocations and prices based on the theory of mechanism design, adapted to dynamic settings.Drawing on their own recent work on the topic, the authors describe a modern theory of RM that blends the elegant dynamic models from the operations research (OR), management science, and computer science literatures with techniques from the classical mechanism design literature. Illustrating this blending of approaches, they start with well-known complete information, nonstrategic dynamic models that yield elegant explicit solutions. They then add strategic agents that are privately informed and then examine the consequences of these changes on the optimization problem of the designer. Their sequential modeling of both nonstrategic and strategic logic allows a clear picture of the delicate interplay between dynamic trade-offs and strategic incentives. Topics include the sequential assignment of heterogeneous objects, dynamic revenue optimization with heterogeneous objects, revenue maximization in the stochastic and dynamic knapsack model, the interaction between learning about demand and dynamic efficiency, and dynamic models with long-lived, strategic agents."

Relaxing this assumption is, of course, important for various practical applications. This relaxation often results in even more complex models that are less amenable to precise analysis. This is, we believe, an area where more research will prove especially fruitful. This chapter is different from the preceding chapters because we do not focus on a specific model and study it in depth, but rather we briefly survey"

Mixture regression modeling has served as a natural approach to performing covariate analysis based on this quantity. However, existing mixture regression methods with competing risks data either impose parametric assumptions on the conditional risks or require stringent censoring assumptions. In this article, we propose a new semiparametric regression approach for competing risks data under the usual conditional independent censoring mechanism. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. A simple resampling method is proposed to approximate the distribution of the estimated parameters and that of the predicted cumulative incidence functions. Simulation studies and an analysis of a breast cancer dataset demonstrate that our method performs well with realistic sample sizes and is appropriate for practical use."

Although considerable literature has emerged on employee reactions to abusive supervision, the role of job crafting as a coping mechanism has received relatively little attention.Design/methodology/approachUsing qualitative exploration, we conducted semi-structured interviews to examine how individuals engage in job crafting as a means to respond to or cope with abusive supervision. Critical Incident Interview Technique (CIIT) was used to obtain in-depth details of this topic. We analyzed the interview-based data using the thematic analysis (TA) technique. We also integrated topic modeling to cluster the identified categories of job crafting behaviors within our TA. The cultural context of our findings was further analyzed using interpretive phenological analysis (IPA).FindingsThe results of our thematic analysis led to four recurring themes in the interview-data: (1) Job crafting as a viable coping response to abusive supervision; (2) The type of coping relates to the type of crafting: Approach and Avoidance; (3) The role of perceived control; (4) Emotions play a role in the type of crafting employed. Findings from our IPA generated the following super-ordinate themes. (1) Job crafting fluidity, (2) effectiveness of job crafting, (3) resilience and (4) cultural dynamics.Research limitations/implicationsThis research reveals the ways in which individuals may turn to job crafting behaviors as a means to cope following instances of abusive supervision. Given the qualitative exploration of our research approach, we identify generalizability to be an issue.Practical implicationsJob crafting is a proactive phenomenon that equips employees with coping abilities in the workplace. While Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001) suggested that job crafting behaviors tend to be hidden from management, there may be merit in organizations explicitly acknowledging the benefits of allowing employees to be active agents in their work, capable of using multiple domains of job crafting to improve their personal and professional lives (Petrou et al., 2017).Originality/valueThe current research reveals the ways in which individuals may turn to job crafting behaviors as a means to cope, following instances of abusive supervision. We further fine-grained our analysis to explicate employee job crafting behaviors in response to abusive supervision within a cross-cultural domain."
BenthallSebastian2018CCaI,,"Context, Causality, and Information Flow: Implications for Privacy Engineering, Security, and Data Economics","Benthall, Sebastian",2018,,,,,,,"eScholarship, University of California",,"The creators of technical infrastructure are under social and legal pressure to comply with expectations that can be difficult to translate into computational and business logics. This dissertation bridges this gap through three projects that focus on privacy engineering, information security, and data economics, respectively. These projects culminate in a new formal method for evaluating the strategic and tactical value of data: data games. This method relies on a core theoretical contribution building on the work of Shannon, Dretske, Pearl, Koller, and Nissenbaum: a definition of situated information flow as causal flow in the context of other causal relations and strategic choices. The first project studies privacy engineering's use of Contextual Integrity theory (CI), which defines privacy as appropriate information flow according to norms specific to social contexts or spheres. Computer scientists using CI have innovated as they have implemented the theory and blended it with other traditions, such as context-aware computing. This survey examines computer science literature using Contextual Integrity and discovers, among other results, that technical and social platforms that span social contexts challenge CI's current commitment to normative social spheres. Sociotechnical situations can and do defy social expectations with cross-context clashes, and privacy engineering needs its normative theories to acknowledge and address this fact.  This concern inspires the second project, which addresses the problem of building computational systems that comply with data flow and security restrictions such as those required by law. Many privacy and data protection policies stipulate restrictions on the flow of information based on that information's original source. We formalize this concept of privacy as Origin Privacy. This formalization shows how information flow security can be represented using causal modeling. Causal modeling of information security leads to general theorems about the limits of privacy by design as well as a shared language for representing specific privacy concepts such as noninterference, differential privacy, and authorized disclosure. The third project uses the causal modeling of information flow to address gaps in current theory of data economics. Like CI, privacy economics has focused on individual economic contexts and so has been unable to comprehend an information economy that relies on the flow of information across contexts. Data games, an adaptation of Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams for mechanism design, are used to model the well known economic contexts of principal-agent contracts and price differentiation as well as new contexts such as personalized expert services and data reuse. This work reveals that information flows are not goods but rather strategic resources, and that trade in information therefore involves market externalities."

Devereaux1 Published online: 15 June 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016 Complexity economists view social systems as complex, non-equilibrium systems whose dynamics are often nonlinear and therefore, difcult to predict. Norms are the primary target of laissez-faire activist nudge policy (the term norms appears over 100 times in the book). Since experimental and behavioral economics indicate that a large part of individual decision-making relies on heuristics, such as adhering to prevailing norms rather than maximizing utility, the key to inuencing social outcomes is to inuence norms. The authors do not adequately offer a replacement metric.The new policy patterns suggested by the authors are a laundry list of systems theoretical phenomena: nonlinearity (p. 113), emergence (p. 116), multiple equilibria (p. 117), path dependence and lock-in (p. 118), phase transitions(p. 121), diversity (p. 121), power laws (p. 123), networks (p. 125), and agent-based modeling (p. 127). While complex system dynamics tend to make other economists more humble in their policy suggestions, to the point of proving mathematically that any given policy cannot be effectively implemented in a complex system (see Velupillai 2007), Colander and Kupers remain unfazed, applauding expensive, uncertain, and sometimes failed policy experiments to jolt social systems out of what bureaucrats deem to be suboptimal lock-ins (p. 192, 207)."

A longitudinal database is extracted from Statistics Canada Business Register (BR) to determine the duration of survival for small and medium (SME) size business establishments. We follow the annual life trajectory of each establishment in the 1996 population till 2002 and record the year when the establishment failed. Business establishment failure is modeled by specifying and estimating discrete-time hazard duration models for 12 economic sectors. The estimation results suggest that the business failure process can be explained by the establishment characteristics, the industry it belongs to, the geographic location it is at and the macro-economic conditions in the city. The results also indicate a variation in the significance of those factors among the different economic sectors due to establishment heterogeneity."

Methods: Machine-based measures of nicotine yield in smoke and measures of cigarette design features related to nicotine delivery (ventilation, nicotine content in the tobacco rod and number of puffs), as well as market category descriptors, were obtained from annual reports filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public by tobacco manufacturers for 1997–2005. Trends in nicotine yield and its relationship with design features and market parameters were analysed with multilevel mixed-effects regression modelling procedures. Results: A statistically significant trend was confirmed in increased nicotine yield, of 0.019 (1.1%) mg/cig/year over the period 1997–2005 and 0.029 (1.6%) mg/cig/year over the period 1998–2005. The increasing trend was observed in all major market categories (mentholated vs non-mentholated, and full flavour vs light, medium (mild) or ultralight). Nicotine yield in smoke was positively associated with nicotine concentration in the tobacco and number of puffs per cigarette, both of which showed increasing trends during the study period. Conclusions: This study confirms increased machine-measured levels of nicotine, the addictive agent in cigarettes, in smoke, to be a result of increased nicotine in the tobacco rod and other design modifications."

Second, to increase insights in learning from errors, the authors focussed on different types of errors. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey in the insurance industry (N=206). The authors used structural equation modelling and path modelling to analyse the data. To be able to analyse different types of errors, the authors used Critical Incident Technique and asked participants to describe error situations. Findings Findings from the study are that the model of learning from errors could partly be replicated. The results indicate that a non-punitive orientation towards errors is an important factor to reduce the tendency of insurance agents to cover up errors when knowledge and rule-based errors happen. In situations of slips and lapses error strain has a negative influence on trust and non-punitive orientation which in turn both reduce the tendency to cover up errors. Research limitations/implications Limitation is the small sample size. By using Critical Incidents Technique, the authors were able to analyse authentic error situations. Implications of the results concern the importance of error-friendly climate in organisations. Originality/value Replication studies are important to generalise results to different domains. To increase the insight in learning from errors, the authors analysed influencing factors with regard to different types of errors."
YuShumin2017TSaE,,"The Stability and Effectiveness of International Climate Agreements: The Role of Carbon Trade, Bargaining Power and Enforcement","Yu, Shumin",2017,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Relying on individual countries’ efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is insufficient for keeping the rising global average temperature below a level detrimental to humans. Instead, the threat of climate change requires global cooperative efforts to reach significant reductions in GHG emissions. Yet, it is difficult to reach a consensus on sharing the burden of climate change mitigation among nation states because of the free-riding incentives resulting from the public good property of climate change mitigation. In the absence of a supranational agency that takes the role of an enforcer of commitments, the compliance with mitigation commitments is also an obstacle to mitigation cooperation even after an international climate agreement (ICA) has been signed and ratified. To enable effective GHG emissions mitigation, the design of institutional and economic instruments that can facilitate the formation of ICAs is needed. The aim of this thesis is therefore to study the stability and effectiveness of ICAs by considering the impacts of carbon trade, countries’ uneven bargaining powers and enforcement mechanisms. Game theoretical modelling is a useful and appropriate tool to study the incentive mechanisms applied to agents with different preferences, and is often used to study the formation and stability of ICAs. Hence, game theory applies throughout this thesis. To relate the analytical solutions to the real problems in ICAs formation and thus to provide policy insights, numerical models and analyses are also employed and presented in this thesis. While Chapter 1 sets the scene and formulates the research questions, Chapter 2 develops a four-stage coalition formation game in order to study the impact of a carbon market on regional incentives to join an ICA for GHG emissions mitigation when the carbon market is established independently of this agreement. This carbon market, which is assumed to be formed after the mitigation coalition, is open to the mitigation coalition and its outsiders. In particular, the initial emissions permit choice of each participant in the carbon market is based on an endogenous permit choice mechanism introduced by Helm (2003). The impact of this carbon market on incentives to join the mitigation coalition and the interlinkages between the two coalitions are studied. Results show that number and size of stable mitigation coalitions are smaller with than without a carbon market. The intuition is that in the presence of a carbon market, players are faced with more strategic choices implying that members of the stable mitigation coalitions have a potential incentive to deviate from a mitigation coalition and become a carbon trader instead. This can destabilise the mitigation coalition. Because the carbon market offers an alternative or complementary policy instrument to facilitate mitigation, some non-signatories to the mitigation coalition would join a carbon market which helps to reduce global emissions. However, the mitigation coalition has no incentive to join a carbon market with non-signatories, since the benefits from free riding surpass the net gains from carbon trade. It is concluded that even with this dual-agreement system, free-riding incentives prevail and global cooperation does not emerge. Chapter 3 develops a model of an international carbon market where allowances are endogenously determined by each member of a carbon trade agreement, but with an exogenous constraint on the number of allowances per member. A global model is used to explore the incentives for regions to participate in such a carbon market and to examine its performance. Results show that the stability and effectiveness of an international carbon market can be improved by imposing constraints on individual allowance choices compared to a carbon market without such constraints. Constraints on allowance choices reduce “hot air” and increase global welfare and mitigation. Under a relatively lax constraint (12% below BAU emissions in the STACO calibration), a carbon market with the largest membership can be formed. When tightening the constraint the stable carbon markets become smaller but perform better in terms of global abatement and welfare. If the constraint is too tight, however, no stable carbon market can be formed. Moreover, numerical results also demonstrate that by tying individual allowance choice constraints to the Nash-emissions levels, international carbon markets are more successful in terms of global welfare and abatement, as it responds better to individual incentives to participate. Hence, a revision of the baseline could ease current climate negotiations, where BAU emissions are still dominant for defining and negotiating abatement targets or emission allowances. Chapter 4 studies the impact of using the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) for distributing coalitional gains under different sets of bargaining weights on the stability and effectiveness of international climate agreements. International climate negotiations are modelled as a Nash bargaining game in which cooperative gains are distributed based on the NBS with asymmetric bargaining power. In climate negotiations, asymmetric countries’ bargaining powers are unequal and may be driven by different characteristics of the players. By discussing and reviewing potential reasons that could induce differences of negotiators’ bargaining power in international climate negotiations, five different factors that determine negotiators’ bargaining power are identified: i) discount factor; ii) abatement efforts; iii) abatement costs; iv) climate change damages; v) economic power. Numerical results illustrate that the Nash bargaining solution can improve the participation incentives and performances of ICAs as compared to those that do not redistribute gains from cooperation, but its capacity to overcome free-riding incentives is limited. The success of international climate agreements depends on the set of bargaining weights that matters in climate negotiation. Among five sets of asymmetric bargaining weights, the one determined by negotiators’ economic power can facilitate a climate coalition that comprises two of the largest emitters (China and United States) jointly with two other regions (High Income Asia countries and Brazil). In climate policy making multiple determinants of bargaining power will play a role. This is because countries’ incentives to cooperate on GHG mitigation are impacted in a complex way by factors that are related to abatement options, climate change vulnerability and economic power. Hence, the bargaining power of each negotiator is likely to be driven by multiple determinants. Our model can be extended in a straightforward manner to account for different interlinked drivers of bargaining power if these can be determined. Chapter 5 studies the design of an optimal enforcement mechanism for a self-enforcing ICA and the impact of an optimally designed enforcement mechanism on participation and compliance. The model is formulated as a sequential cartel formation game, in which the coalition chooses an enforcement policy comprising an abatement target, monitoring expenditures and fines. Individual signatories respond by choosing their preferred abatement level which may or may not comply with the target. In equilibrium, signatories’ compliance levels are determined by individual welfare maximization under the agreed enforcement policy. Considering partial compliance, it is demonstrated that the extent of compliance depends on abatement targets, monitoring expenditures (the intensity of monitoring) and the fine. Results show that the compliance level of a coalition member can always be improved by increasing the monitoring expenditure. However, the effect of the target on compliance levels depends on the structure of the fine function. The coalitional best abatement level can be induced as a joint result of the monitoring expenditure and the target when the fine function is quadratic. Because monitoring is costly, full compliance will usually not be enforced. As to the stability, a “broad” and “deep” climate coalition cannot be formed with a costly enforcement mechanism. Four conclusions can be drawn from this thesis. First, establishing a carbon market outside of a mitigation coalition may not help to improve countries’ incentives to join the mitigation coalition, while the global mitigation level can be increased because the carbon market offers an alternative or complementary policy instrument to facilitate mitigation. Second, imposing a constraint with moderate degrees of strictness on initial allowance choices can increase the mitigation effectiveness and participation level of an international carbon market. Moreover, changing the baseline of the constraint from the BAU emissions level to the non-cooperative Nash level can also be considered a way to improve the success of an international carbon market. Third, factors that could influence bargaining powers of negotiating countries can be brought up and determined at pre-stage of international climate negotiations. Hence, policy designers for negotiations of ICAs may consider to use the determinants of bargaining power that can enhance large emitters’ bargaining position to improve the mitigation effectiveness of ICAs. Fourth, due to the existence of free-riding incentives in the process of compliance with mitigation commitments, an optimally designed enforcement policy is needed for the successful implementation of ICAs."
NamanySarah2019SDfE,,Sustainable Decision-Making for Efficient Resource Management: A Food Security Case Study,"Namany, Sarah",2019,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Food security is one of the most pressing current resource management problems. It has become a concern for many countries in the light of changing climatic conditions, unpredictable instabilities and increasing consumption of resources. The purpose of this thesis is to address food availability as part of the food security challenge, through suggesting a modular framework that tackles major complexities hindering efficient decision-making within the food sector. The methodology suggested is based on a bottom up approach comprised, aiming at a first stage, at enhancing local production. Three decision-making techniques are used as part of this research thesis. The first module is based on a combination of single-objective optimization models based on linear programming, stochastic programming, and game theory approach. The results obtained demonstrate that interesting interactions between systems, albeit competitive, can potentially result in the achievement of desired objectives under properly regulated markets, and is therefore envisaged as a promising contribution towards sustainable policy development and nexus governance. The second module suggests a methodology that utilises the nexus thinking to influence decision-making within the food sector considering the uncertainty in natural gas prices. It assesses technology alternatives for a domestic food production case in Qatar based on economic and environmental performance represented by global warming potential (GWP). Findings indicate that diversifying the energy and water mix through introducing more than 70% of renewable energy technologies reduces the environmental impact. The last section of the thesis integrates international trade into the analysis of the food sector through proposing a dynamic decision-making scheme that simulates strategies of the perishable food market in Qatar under different circumstances. The case is modelled using an agent-based model (ABM)."

This paper joins this debate, aiming to examine the complex role of consumer participation by empirically testing a theoretical model within the online context of consumer using product recommendation agents (RAs) that integrates consumer participation into the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Design/methodology/approach Data was collected from 243 respondents comprising both genders with varied age groups, education levels, household income, and ethnicities. Participants interacted with an existing RA, searching product information for a simulated purchase involving either high or low financial risk. CFA and SEM were used for assessing construct validity and testing hypotheses respectively. Findings Consumer participation was found to positively affect enjoyment but negatively affect perceived ease of use of an RA, which was exacerbated when the purchase was of high financial risk. Predictions based on TAM were all supported in this study. Research limitations/implications This research evidenced consumer participation’s dual-effect and identified financial risk as a moderator of consumer participation’ negative effect. Future research could employ a different design such as using controlled lab settings and conducting longitudinal studies to replicate the study. Practical implications Findings from this research provide guidance to RA design regarding the amount of consumer participation, consumer perceptions of RA use (ease of use, usefulness, and enjoyment), and financial risk involved in the purchase. Originality/value This research sheds new light on the role of consumer participation through uncovering its dual-effect, thus complementing the services marketing and RA literature."
TyurinKonstantin2003Smoc,,Semiparametric modeling of competing risks in a limit order market,"Tyurin, Konstantin",2003,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This dissertation is based on three papers that have come out of the research conducted at Yale University during 1999–2001 and finished in Indiana University during 2002. Chapter two introduces the competing risks methodology as an empirical tool for modeling high-frequency financial data in continuous time. The competing risks are applied to the analysis of the timing and interaction between the Deutsche Mark/U.S. dollar quotes and transactions in the Reuters D2000-2 electronic brokerage system. Estimation of the model mostly supports the empirical evidence from previous research on electronic limit order markets. In particular, the composition of order flow is found to be sensitive to the state of the limit order book and the trading history. The direction of past trade is found to have strong predictive power for the future market activity. The model detects an adverse information effect due to non-trading as the traders submit and cancel their orders most aggressively immediately after the limit order book events. Chapter three studies the problem of semiparametric hazard rate estimation in the competing risks environment. Special attention is paid to the situation where the sample of observed durations is highly skewed, which is fairly common for high-frequency financial data. The chapter provides a review of large sample properties of alternative k-nearest neighbor estimators and local linear smoothers. The asymptotic theory is applied to the problem of baseline hazard rate estimation for a large number of limit order book events. Chapter four extends the results of the previous chapters. The set of covariates is expanded to include a broad range of limit order trading and liquidity characteristics. The cross-sectional and serial correlation of Cox regression residuals is captured by the past order flow and the counts of recent transactions. The principal component analysis applied to the covariate indices identifies five pervasive factors that explain a major portion of trading activity. The multifactor modification leads to substantial data compression, improves the goodness-of-fit, and boosts the short-term predictive power of the model relative to popular moving average-type forecasting rules. The competing risks methodology provides a valuable framework for understanding and forecasting the behavior of heterogeneous agents in a competitive market environment."

However, existing model-based approaches for profit maximization of EVCSs may exhibit poor performance owing to the underutilization of massive data and inaccurate modeling of EVCS operation in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, the existing approaches can be vulnerable to adversaries that abuse private EVCS operation data for malicious purposes. To resolve these limitations, we propose a privacy-preserving distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that maximizes the profits of multiple smart EVCSs integrated with photovoltaic and energy storage systems under a dynamic pricing strategy. In the proposed framework, DRL agents using the soft actor–critic method determine the schedules of the profitable selling price and charging/discharging energy for EVCSs. To preserve the privacy of EVCS operation data, a federated reinforcement learning method is adopted in which only the local and global neural network models of the DRL agents are exchanged between the DRL agents at the EVCSs and the global agent at the central server without sharing EVCS data. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of convergence of the training curve for the DRL agent, adaptive profitable selling price, energy charging and discharging, sensitivity of the selling price factor, and varying weather conditions. •Development of a pricing strategy for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs).•The strategy is based on a privacy-preserving deep reinforcement learning method.•Profitable selling prices for the owners of EVCSs are calculated.•An economical energy charging and discharging scheduling of EVCSs is conducted.•Simulation results prove the profitability and efficient energy management of EVCSs."
OkelloCandiyaBongominGeorge2020Tmbm,,Trust: mediator between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion,"Okello Candiya Bongomin, George and Ntayi, Joseph",2020,Social responsibility journal,16,8,1215-1237,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose Recently, a large body of research has been devoted on the role of trust in shaping different types of transactions, especially in rural financial development. Trust is a set of expectations shared by all those who engage in an exchange. Indeed, the “rule of the game” suggests that no trusting party in a transaction should act opportunistically. Consequently, this study aims to establish the mediating effect of trust in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion of MSMEs in developing countries with a specific focus on rural Uganda. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative survey-based study was used and responses obtained from 379 MSMEs located in northern Uganda were analysed using partial least square-PLS version 3.0. A semi-structured questionnaire was developed from scales and items used in previous studies referenced in internationally recognised journals to elicit responses from the MSMEs. Structural equation modelling was used to test the models to arrive at a final empirical model derived from the data. Findings The authors found evidence that trust enhances mobile money adoption and usage to increase the scope of financial inclusion of MSMEs in developing countries. Moreover, when individual effect was determined, trust also had significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Thus, the study results imply that trust enhances mobile money adoption and usage to improve the level of financial inclusion of MSMEs in developing countries. Research limitations/implications The study used cross-sectional data to document the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion and to establish the mediating effect of trust in the relationship. Future research could use relevant longitudinal data to verify other benefits of trust. Practical implications The results present trust as a significant factor for FINTECH financial services marketing and growth. Specifically, data privacy and effectiveness of the mobile telephone network is more likely to help consumers to bridge the gap between participation and non-participation on the mobile money platform. Customers’ data sent over the mobile network of providers should be protected from unnecessary access and usage by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) staff and unauthorised persons and agents. Data protection protocols should be set by the MNOs to avoid unnecessary access and use of customers’ data. Originality/value Globally, Fintech scholars have examined the role of mobile money in promoting financial inclusion. However, there is insufficient evidence on the mediating effect of trust in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion, especially among rural MSMEs. This study invents a novel direction on the importance of trust in creating transaction efficiency by eliminating opportunism and fraud with in the Fintech ecosystem."
SantanamRaghuT1999Cmob,,Computational modeling of business processes: A coordination mechanism approach,"Santanam, Raghu T",1999,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Recent research on business process design has mainly focused either on technology or on workflow aspects of business processes. Technology efforts involve automating tasks that are time consuming and repetitious. On the other hand, workflow redesign efforts concentrate only on the flow of work or information. Either approach fails to fully capture all the aspects of a business process. The dissertation makes a threefold contribution to the existing literature on coordination in business processes. First, it presents an integrative approach to business process understanding that synthesizes economic, behavioral, and mechanistic concerns of different research streams in management. Second, it develops a computational modeling language for specifying the coordination mechanisms of organizational processes and describes an abstract machine that can simulate such process specifications. The novelty of the language lies in the modeling of agents as utility maximizing entities whose decision choices are influenced by incentive mechanisms. Third, it utilizes the modeling approach developed earlier to investigate the comparative performance of a number of commonly used incentive schemes in a delegated investment process. The computational study provides useful insights into the delegated investment problem on the issues of incentive design, effect of market uncertainties and the effect of risk aversion. The results also demonstrate the effect of the different incentives on the risk-return tradeoffs exhibited by the agents. The dissertation is organized into three main essays as follows. In the first essay, the coordination framework is developed and two illustrative cases are described using this framework. The coordination mechanism framework recognizes workflow, decision, information, and agency structures as important aspects of a business process. In the second essay the specifications of a modeling language which capture the various aspects of the coordination framework are presented. In this modeling approach, agents' decision choices are influenced by the design of the incentive mechanisms, through the agents' utility maximizing behavior. Facilities for modeling pools and groups of agents are also made available in this language. In the third essay, simulation experiments are conducted to analyze the relative performance of incentive mechanisms in a delegated investment setting. The impact of a few alternative arrangements of performance incentive fee on the behavior of the investment managers and the resulting investment performance is examined. The computational results demonstrate the risk-return tradeoffs that agents exhibit in a delegated investment setting, and how such behavior is affected by the nature of incentive contracts."
HammadiSlim2013Mts,,Multimodal transport systems,"Hammadi, Slim and Ksouri, Mekki",2013,,,,,,,WILEY,Newark,"The use and management of multimodal transport systems, including car-pooling and goods transportation, have become extremely complex, due to their large size (sometimes several thousand variables), the nature of their dynamic relationships as well as the many constraints to which they are subjected. The managers of these systems must ensure that the system works as efficiently as possible by managing the various causes of malfunction of the transport system (vehicle breakdowns, road obstructions, accidents, etc.). The detection and resolution of conflicts, which are particularly complex and must be dealt with in real time, are currently processed manually by operators. However, the experience and abilities of these operators are no longer sufficient when faced with the complexity of the problems to be solved. It is thus necessary to provide them with an interactive tool to help with the management of disturbances, enabling them to identify the different disturbances, to characterize and prioritize these disturbances, to process them by taking into account their specifics and to evaluate the impact of the decisions in real time. Each chapter of this book can be broken down into an approach for solving a transport problem in 3 stages, i.e. modeling the problem, creating optimization algorithms and validating the solutions. The management of a transport system calls for knowledge of a variety of theories (problem modeling tools, multi-objective problem classification, optimization algorithms, etc.). The different constraints increase its complexity drastically and thus require a model that represents as far as possible all the components of a problem in order to better identify it and propose corresponding solutions. These solutions are then evaluated according to the criteria of the transport providers as well as those of the city transport authorities. This book consists of a state of the art on innovative transport systems as well as the possibility of coordinating with the current public transport system and the authors clearly illustrate this coordination within the framework of an intelligent transport system."

We use a two-period agency model in which contractibility is limited and agents meet a fixed delivery quota each period. A costly audit is triggered in any period if the delivery quota of output for the period is not met. We show that the informativeness of the audit plays a crucial role in resolving coordination problems between agents when they are organized as a team. When the audit is perfectly informative about agent productivity and inventory levels, team-based production is optimal. The team meets its quota even though, in equilibrium, the audit never takes place. If the audit is not perfectly informative about inventory levels, we show that team-based production typically induces agents to endogenously reduce inventory levels and could even result in agents adopting a zero-inventory policy. When the audit is completely uninformative, individual production is superior to team-based production."
GoelGagan2014CABH,,Clinching Auctions Beyond Hard Budget Constraints,"Goel, Gagan and Mirrokni, Vahab and Renato Paes Leme",2014,arXiv.org,,,,,,"Cornell University Library, arXiv.org",Ithaca,"Constraints on agent's ability to pay play a major role in auction design for any setting where the magnitude of financial transactions is sufficiently large. Those constraints have been traditionally modeled in mechanism design as \emph{hard budget}, i.e., mechanism is not allowed to charge agents more than a certain amount. Yet, real auction systems (such as Google AdWords) allow more sophisticated constraints on agents' ability to pay, such as \emph{average budgets}. In this work, we investigate the design of Pareto optimal and incentive compatible auctions for agents with \emph{constrained quasi-linear utilities}, which captures more realistic models of liquidity constraints that the agents may have. Our result applies to a very general class of allocation constraints known as polymatroidal environments, encompassing many settings of interest such as multi-unit auctions, matching markets, video-on-demand and advertisement systems. Our design is based Ausubel's \emph{clinching framework}. Incentive compatibility and feasibility with respect to ability-to-pay constraints are direct consequences of the clinching framework. Pareto-optimality, on the other hand, is considerably more challenging, since the no-trade condition that characterizes it depends not only on whether agents have their budgets exhausted or not, but also on prices {at} which the goods are allocated. In order to get a handle on those prices, we introduce novel concepts of dropping prices and saturation. These concepts lead to our main structural result which is a characterization of the tight sets in the clinching auction outcome and its relation to dropping prices."
OduroSamuelDua2016BEMo,,"Bayesian Econometric Modelling of Informed Trading, Bid-Ask Spread and Volatility","Oduro, Samuel Dua",2016,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Recent developments in global financial markets have increased the need for research aimed at the measurement and possible reduction of liquidity risk. In particular, market crashes have been partly blamed on the sudden withdrawal of liquidity in markets and increases in liquidity risk. To this end, it is important to develop better approaches for inferring or quantifying liquidity risk. Liquidity risk caused by some investors trading on their information advantage (informed trading) has been a subject of market microstructure research in the last few decades. Researchers have employed information-based models that use observed or inferred order flow to investigate this problem. The Probability of Informed Trading (PIN) is a measure which uses inferred order flow to quantify the extent information asymmetry. However, a number of computational issues have been reported to effect the estimation of PIN. Using an alternative methodology, we address the numerical problem associated with the estimation of PIN. Varied evidence of a relationship between volume and bid-ask spread has been documented in the extant literature. In particular, theory suggests that bid-ask spread and volume are jointly driven by a common process as both variables measure an aspect of liquidity. The complex relationship between these variables is time-varying since the informed trading component of order flow changes as trading takes place. Thus, volume and bid-ask spread may provide insight on the time-varying composition of economic agents trading an asset. We exploit the nonlinear relationship between traded volume and bid-ask spread to develop a model that can be used to infer informed and uninformed trading components of volume. The structure of the model and estimation methodology enhances the sequential processing and incorporation of past volume and bid-ask spread as conditioning information. The model is applied to two equities that trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Finally, to increase our understanding on the effects of liquidity risk on volatility, we also examine whether separating volume into informed and uninformed components can provide further insight on the relationship between liquidity risk and volatility."
MuKunpeng2023FCPo,,Forecasting Contagion Processes on Heterogeneous Complex Networks,"Mu, Kunpeng",2023,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Real-time epidemic forecasting using mathematical and computational models of infectious disease transmission is increasingly used to provide scenario analysis and forecasts to help public health agencies and the society to react and respond to emergent infectious disease outbreaks, such as the most recent COVID-19 pandemic. In my thesis, I utilized the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEAM) model which combines the real-world data on human mixing patterns and short-range and long-range human mobility networks with elaborate stochastic models of disease transmission to analyze the spatiotemporal spreading and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and proposed to use the energy score to evaluate the performance of probabilistic forecasts that are provided in the format of quantiles or intervals and identify the most plausible scenario and the best performance model for each round of the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub project. In Chapter 1, I introduced the important role that epidemic modeling plays during the COVID-19 pandemic and why a collaborative modeling hub is needed to make reliable and robust projections to help with policy makers on integrating predictive modeling into decision-making process. Besides, I pointed out the different goals for short-term and long-term forecasts. I briefly introduced each of my research projects, and summarized my publications at the end of this chapter. In Chapter 2, I reported my contributions to the development of a data-driven approach to build the age-stratified contact networks by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data from publicly available sources on key socio-demographic features (such as: age structure, household composition and members’ age gaps, employment rates, school and community structures, etc.) and studied the importance of the heterogeneity of age contact patterns in epidemic modeling. The age-stratified contact networks were then integrated into the a traditional SLIR-like compartment model and the GLEAM model to analyze the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic. In Chapter 3, I proposed an approach by using machine learning algorithms and socio-economic, demographic and meteorological features (such as: population size, distance, purchase power parity, language, currency, etc.) to predict the monthly air passenger flows to reproduce an analogous origin-destination network to the one obtained from the Official Airline Guide (OAG) database. The predicted origin-destination network will be integrated into the GLEAM model to account for the long-range human travel patterns instead of purchasing the data from OAG every year. In Chapter 4, I applied the age-stratified contact networks in an extended SLIR-like model to participate the Multi-Model Outbreak Decision Support (MMODS) project launched by Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) network in mid-May 2020 to evaluate the effectiveness and study the trade-offs between economic and public health outcomes of four reopening strategies of a generic mid-sized US county in a novel process designed to fully express scientific uncertainty while reducing linguistic uncertainty and cognitive biases. Control of COVID-19 pandemic in such populations will be helpful in decision-making faced by state and local officials. In Chapter 5, I utilized a multi-scale modeling approach that combines two distinct epidemic models that work at different geographical resolutions (the Global Epidemic and Mobility model (GLEAM) and the Local Epidemic and Mobility model in the US (LEAM-US)) to produce long-term probabilistic forecasts based on scenarios aimed at enveloping the future drivers of the COVID-19 trajectory in the US (Vaccine delivery/administration, SARS-CoV-2 variants prevalence, relaxation of non-pharmaceuticals interventions (NPIs), etc.) at the state and national level in US. Then our results are aggregated in the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub to make ensemble projections and provide guidance for decision-makers, public health experts, and the general public to response the the COVID-19 pandemic. Chapter 6 reports the last project of my PhD research, which focus on the evaluation of performances of probabilistic forecasts from different COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub models and scenarios for all projection rounds by using the energy score: a generalization of the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). The energy score is defined as a function of data distances and quantifies both the calibration and sharpness of a predictive distributions in a single value. I also proposed a standardization or normalization method to overcome a drawback of the original multivariate energy score that does not make any distinction between the components of the forecast vector. The research work illustrated in my thesis shows how we integrate real-world data into the GLEAM model to produce projections about COVID-19 epidemic in US and help with policy makers on integrating predictive modeling into decision-making processes as well as evaluate probabilistic forecasts by utilizing the energy score. The frameworks and approaches presented here are flexible and extendable such that they can contribute in addressing the future challenges faced by decision makers in developing intervention strategies to fight against other real-world epidemics. 7"

BelwalkarShibani2018Trbw,,"The relationship between workplace spirituality, job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviors – an empirical study","Belwalkar, Shibani and Vohra, Veena and Pandey, Ashish",2018,Social responsibility journal,14,2,410-430,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the relationships between workplace spirituality, job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs). It examines the relationship between the three workplace spirituality components – meaning and purpose in work, recognition of an inner life or spirit and interconnectedness with OCBs, mediated by the job satisfaction experienced by the employees, in the context of an Indian private sector bank. A sample consisting of 613 banking employees is studied. The results provide considerable support for all except one of the hypothesized relationships between workplace spirituality components and OCBs. Workplace spirituality components also all led to job satisfaction in employees, and job satisfaction tested positive for a relationship with OCBs. This study can provide significant inputs to promote managerial effectiveness and change management, leadership and holistic performance and growth of organizations, through environments that promote workplace spirituality. Design/methodology/approach The objective of this research is the study of the relationship between the constructs, a spirituality at work, i.e. the independent variable, and OCBs (OCBs), i.e. the dependent variable, and to explore the possibility of the mediating effects of job satisfaction. As the nature of this empirical study is rigorous, and one which will pave the way toward theory building, this research adopts a positivist orientation quantitative method throughout because it is deemed most suitable as it allows testing the validity of the main measure (the integration profile) and the theory using hypotheses and establishing relationships, and at the same time, it allows the researcher to remain independent from the research participants (Reswell, 1994). Consequently, the findings will be very useful to answer the most important research question of this study, which is to inform managers and employers whether workplace spirituality affects employees’ job satisfaction and OCBs. Findings Using the SPSS statistical package and the partial least square structured equation modeling analysis software tool, the research data have been analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative results suggest that there is a positive relationship between the dependent variable, OCBs, and the independent variables, meaning and purpose and interconnectedness. The inner life dimension of workplace spirituality did to correlate to the single factor of OCB analyzed, but individually inner life had a significant positive relationship with the individual components of OCB – altruism, civic virtue, courtesy and sportsmanship, except conscientiousness. The correlations established the relationships, and the regression analysis identified the relevant factors that had causal relationship. The 163 validity and reliability of the measurement instruments were confirmed by the high internal consistency. Research limitations/implications Improving organizational citizenship is one of the lowest costs and best ways to encourage organizational effectiveness. This research is important for businesses that want to create competence and organizational effectiveness. Indian contextual studies (non-Western context) on both workplace spirituality and organizational outcomes are few and keeping in mind the growth of Indian industry, the evolving workforce and demands being made on workplaces, a study like this is significant. The studies stated that businesses should act as agents of national progress and development and as socially responsible citizens contributing to the environment and influencing well-being. This would require a strong and hard look at current management practices. Allio (2011) stated that as a result of the consequences of questionable and corrupt corporate practices, there is a strong need felt to articulate a new sense of purpose of the firm, corporate character and culture, survival, sustainability and innovation. Thaker (2011) advocated the same view as he stated that the current management and organizational policies, principles and practices are focused on a view of self-interest. This results in socially and environmentally dysfunctional organizations. An alternative approach is workplace spirituality (Al-Qutop and Harrim, 2014). Practical implications Strategic implementation of workplace spirituality is an upcoming focus and priority area of work for human resource managers (Marques, 2005). The human resource department’s role in designing and developing strategies that embrace spirituality, with the intention of developing a culture aimed toward the successful achievement of both business and individual or personal goals, is very critical for the management. By using statistical analysis to demonstrate whether or not a relationship exists between one or more of the determinants of spirituality and one or more of the determinants of job satisfaction, leaders may be better able to understand why certain individuals are able to remain passionate about their work. Leaders can integrate the appropriate determinants that may correlate to job satisfaction into the organizational culture, resulting in improved job satisfaction for all within the organization. The outcomes can provide a significant contribution to the body of knowledge for spirituality within organizations, as well as knowledge of factors that influence job satisfaction and motivation. Social implications The inherent nature of this study is intimately connected to its objective, purpose and significance. It is also based on the fundamental realization that managers and leaders today have a larger responsibility in society, one that extends beyond their routine functions and basic tasks of running a business. Leadership decisions can and do have a profound lasting effect on the larger community and society within which they operate. This study and the methods that have been adopted for this research are intended to add to the growing body of knowledge on managerial perceptions, and implications of the process of introducing and practicing workplace spirituality. Originality/value Studies in the Indian context of workplace spirituality and outcomes are rare. Particular studies in the banking sector are lesser. This research aims at studying the link between workplace spirituality, job satisfaction and OCBs, in the context of an Indian private sector bank, which is very unique. Earlier studies have tested the relationships independently, but have not examined the relationships of all three variables together."

LemmingGitte2010Lcao,,Life cycle assessment of soil and groundwater remediation technologies: literature review,"Lemming, Gitte and Hauschild, Michael Z. and Bjerg, Poul L.",2010,The international journal of life cycle assessment,15,1,115-127,,,Springer-Verlag,Berlin/Heidelberg,"Background, aim, and scope Life cycle assessment (LCA) is becoming an increasingly widespread tool in support systems for environmental decision-making regarding the cleanup of contaminated sites. In this study, the use of LCA to compare the environmental impacts of different remediation technologies was reviewed. Remediation of a contaminated site reduces a local environmental problem, but at the same time, the remediation activities may cause negative environmental impacts on the local, regional, and global scale. LCA can be used to evaluate the inherent trade-off and to compare remediation scenarios in terms of their associated environmental burden. Main features An overview of the assessed remediation technologies and contaminant types covered in the literature is presented. The LCA methodologies of the 12 reviewed studies were compared and discussed with special focus on their goal and scope definition and the applied impact assessment. The studies differ in their basic approach since some are prospective with focus on decision-support while others are retrospective aiming at a more detailed assessment of a completed remediation project. Literature review The literature review showed that only few life cycle assessments have been conducted for in situ remediation technologies aimed at groundwater-threatening contaminants and that the majority of the existing literature focuses on ex situ remediation of contaminated soil. The functional unit applied in the studies is generally based on the volume of contaminated soil (or groundwater) to be treated; this is in four of the studies combined with a cleanup target for the remediation. While earlier studies often used more simplified impact assessment models, the more recent studies based their impact assessment on established methodologies covering the conventional set of impact categories. Ecotoxicity and human toxicity are the impact categories varying the most between these methodologies. Many of the reviewed studies address the importance of evaluating both primary and secondary impacts of site remediation. Primary impacts cover the local impacts related to residual contamination left in the subsurface during and after remediation and will vary between different remediation technologies due to different cleanup efficiencies and cleanup times. Secondary impacts are resource use and emissions arising in other stages of the life cycle of the remediation project. Discussion Among the reviewed literature, different approaches for modeling the long-term primary impacts of site contamination have been used. These include steady state models as well as dynamic models. Primary impacts are not solely a soil contamination or surface water issue, since many frequently occurring contaminants, such as chlorinated solvents, have the potential to migrate to the groundwater as well as evaporate to ambient air causing indoor climate problems. Impacts in the groundwater compartment are not included in established impact assessment methodologies; thus, the potential groundwater contamination impacts from residual contamination are difficult to address in LCA of site remediation. Due to the strong dependence on local conditions (sensitivity of groundwater aquifer, use for drinking water supply, etc.) a more site-specific impact assessment approach than what is normally applied in LCA is of relevance. Conclusions, recommendations, and perspectives The inclusion of groundwater impacts from soil contaminants requires the definition of an impact category covering human toxicity via groundwater or the inclusion of these impacts in the human toxicity impact category and the associated characterization models and normalization procedures. When evaluating groundwater impacts, attention should also be paid to potentially degradable contaminants forming metabolites of higher human toxic concern than the parent compound."

However, we are unsure of the bidders strategies and their effectiveness in achieving auction goals. Our study was an attempt to identify bidding strategies empirically in online single-unit auctions and evaluate their outcome in terms of cost saving, perceived bidder enjoyment, and bidder satisfaction. A research model was developed and used to examine the relationships. Both objective and subjective data of online single-unit auctions were collected from Taobao.com to validate our postulated hypotheses. We found three main bidding strategies: early, snipe, and agent-supported ratchet bidding based on their behavior patterns. These resulted in different levels of winning outcome and cost saving, but had no significant effect on perceived enjoyment. The hypotheses of the relationship between auction outcomes and bidder satisfaction of their bidding strategies were confirmed."

Monetary policy appropriateness in South Africa,"Leshoro, Temitope and Kollamparambil, Umakrishnan",2016,PSL quarterly review,69,276,77-104,,,Assoc Paolo Sylos Labini,ROME,"Abstract The design and implementation of the monetary policy in South Africa has been based on the idea of a trade-off between inflation and output growth. However, there is no consensus among empirical investigations on the existence of Phillips curve in the present times. The significant contribution of this study is to estimate the Hybrid New Keynesian Phillips Curve model with a view to determine whether Phillips curve exists and ascertain whether the backward-looking or forward-looking components drive inflation dynamics in South Africa using OLS and GMM estimation techniques. The results obtained confirmed that the Phillips curve does not exist in South Africa using various measures of demand-side variable. These findings are robust across estimation methodologies as well as different measurements of inflation expectations and data frequency. Our findings therefore support the argument that the monetary policy ought to aim at targeting growth rather than inflation. While our findings indicate that economic agents in South Africa are both rational and adaptive in predicting inflation, the results clearly indicate the dominance of forward looking variables over the backward looking ones in driving inflation."

In the suggested model, two kinds of economic agents are considered. On the one hand, the government makes the investment decision for the traffic network improvement based on the current traffic condition under the limited budget. On the other hand, households and companies will choose their locations according to the attraction of each traffic zone related to the road network accessibility and the housing price. Therefore, the land use is indicated by the population and employment distributions through the evolution process. Besides, the improvement of road capacity is modeled by a general bi-level programming of traffic network design. Simulation experiments show that the city will be more efficient and will have higher average accessibility for employment and population in the evolution process."

Understanding the degree to which firms attempt to manage forces and pressures in the external business environment is key to understanding marketing's role in impeding vs aiding public policy initiatives, and is the problem this research investigates.Design/methodology/approachUsing structural equation modeling, data from 71 firms demonstrate that managing the sociopolitical force is, in fact, distinct from managing the other four market-based forces – consumer demand, supplier power, competition and technological shifts. Managing the sociopolitical force is shown to require fundamentally different skills and resources.FindingsResults suggest that firm sociopolitical receptivity drives attempts to influence this unique external business environmental force, in turn limiting marketplace sociopolitical receptivity. Furthermore, attempts to influence such a unique force relies on resource-light marketing resources, which limits resource-heavy marketing.Originality/valueManaging a political force with marketplace ramifications involves strategy that utilizes marketing, but is driven by relationships with social and political agents. This is truly an environmental management concept distinct from the management of the other four market-based forces. The analysis in this study demonstrates that managing another environmental force (i.e. competition force) involves different receptivity influences and marketing tactic outcomes."

BykhovskayaAnna2019PETa,,Peer Effects: Theory and Measurement,"Bykhovskaya, Anna",2019,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Peer effects are pervasive in human society, existing across the entire socio-politico-economic spectrum. Their presence affects decisions at the individual level and in policy making at industry and societal levels. My research is concerned with explaining the effect of existence vs. non-existence of these linkages, as well as their magnitude and potential emergence over time. I focus on two instances that are relevant in applications: matching markets and social or trade networks. The thesis contributes to the development of the micro-theory of equilibrium in the presence of peer effects and to the advancement of the econometric techniques to analyze the evolution of networks over time.The first part of the dissertation studies the effects that interactions may play in the prediction and estimation of socio-economic systems such as networks. Many interactive structures are not fixed over time and may be expected to evolve in systematic ways. The growing availability of time series data for social and economic networks makes it possible to model and estimate this evolution. I develop such a modeling framework to study network evolution together with econometric procedures to estimate the parameters of the system. I build a multivariate time series system whose components can be interpreted as weighted edges of some network, and I treat the number of time periods as large compared to the size of the network. The model is nonparametric with respect to the distribution of the errors and specifies the temporal evolution of a weighted graph that combines classical autoregression (AR) with non-negativity, a positive probability of vanishing, and peer effect interactions between weights assigned to edges in the process.My main results provide criteria for stationarity/explosiveness of the network evolution process and techniques for estimation of the parameters of the model and for prediction of its future values. The asymptotic theory is much more complex than that of the classical AR model and the results are novel in nonlinear time series modeling. Due to censoring, the naïve ordinary least squares estimator for the parameters of the model is unreliable. But in this network AR setting an estimator based on minimization of the absolute deviations is always consistent and is asymptotically normal in the stationary cases.Natural applications arise in networks of fixed number of agents, such as countries, large corporations, or small social communities. The paper provides an empirical implementation of the approach to monthly trade data in European Union. Computations show that the new model leads to improved performance over the most naïve (but standard benchmark) prediction that ""tomorrow=today"" in network evolution. Overall, the results confirm that incorporating non-negativity of dependent variables into the model matters and incorporating peer effects leads to the improved prediction power.The second part of the dissertation looks at the role that peer effects play in the school matching problem. In economic theory the relationship between schools or colleges and students is usually modeled as a two-sided matching problem. Yet a challenge in matching models with peer effects is equilibrium existence. Despite much progress in the study of stable matchings in the presence of peer effects, there is still no simple criterion for existence that applies to a wide class of models.My research takes a step in this direction. I consider an economy where agents are characterized by their types (e.g. SAT scores) and schools are characterized by their values (e.g. teaching quality) and capacities. Agents and schools are divided into groups, so that going to a school outside one's group may be associated with additional costs or even be prohibited. For example, schools sometimes only accept those who live in specified areas. Students receive utility from the school per se and from classmates. A key role in the analysis is played by a directed graph that governs the possibility to move from one group to another. I find that a sufficient condition for a stable matching to exist is that the graph should not have (directed or undirected) cycles. Under these conditions, I construct a polynomial time algorithm for finding a stable matching. Acyclicity ensures that the algorithm must terminate. While non-directed cycles do not play a major role in previous work, here they are of the same importance as directed cycles. Furthermore, I show that if the graph has a cycle, then there exist other economic parameters (types, costs and so on) so that no stable matching exists."

Design/methodology/approach A socio-computational approach is adopted to model business transactions and supply chain formation in Marshallian industrial districts (IDs). An agent-based model is presented and used as a virtual lab to test the hypotheses between the firms’ behaviour and the emergence of structural properties at the system level. Findings The simulation findings and their validation based on the comparison with a real world cluster show that the topological properties of the emerging network are influenced by the learning strategies and decision-making criteria firms use when choosing partners. With reference to the specific case of Marshallian IDs it is shown that inertial learning based on history and past collaboration represents in the long term a major impediment for the emergence of hubs and of a network topology that is more conducive to innovation and growth. Research limitations/implications The paper offers an alternative view of entrepreneurial learning (EL) as opposed to the dominant view in which learning occurs as a result of exceptional circumstances (e.g. failure). The results presented in this work show that adaptive, situated, and day-by-day learning has a profound impact on the performance of entrepreneurial clusters. These results are encouraging to motivate additional research in areas such as in modelling learning or in the application of the proposed approach to the analysis of other types of entrepreneurial ecosystems, such as start-up networks and makers’ communities. Practical implications Agent-based model can support policymakers in identifying situated factors that can be leveraged to produce changes at the macro-level through the identification of suitable incentives and social networks re-engineering. Originality/value The paper presents a novel perspective on EL and offers evidence that micro-learning strategies adopted and developed in routine business transactions do have an impact on firms’ performances (survival and growth) as well as on systemic performances related to the creation and diffusion of innovation in firms networks."

The paper introduces a model that explains and examines the process through which the perceived assistive intent of an E-retailer leads to improved patronage intentions towards the web site. Design/methodology/approach – A survey on the most recent e-purchase experiences of more than 600 individuals in North America was conducted. Structural equation modelling based on EQS 6.1 was used to assess the measurement and structural models. Findings – Results indicated that customers’ impressions of an E-retailer's assistive intent positively impact web site patronage intentions both directly and indirectly through two key constructs of e-shopping, including web site involvement and web site attitudes. Research limitations/implications – The student sample is not representative of the population. Students are familiar with internet and feel less need for assistance online. Another shortcoming might be its settings. Since the survey was on the respondents’ most recent online experiences, the data quality depends on the amount and accuracy of the information they could retrieve from memory. Practical implications – The findings suggest that E-retailers would highly benefit from investing in the development of an assistive image. To do so, E-retailers should leverage the interactive nature of the web and provide supportive tools that facilitate the e-shopping task of clients. Social implications – Developing impressions of the site's assistive intent is highly rewarding for E-retailers that are new to the business. Originality/value – This paper represents the first effort to link the newly developed construct of E-retailer's assistive intent to two fundamental variables of online shopping, including web site involvement and web site attitudes. This work would also be an extension of the past studies that call for further investigation of the link between customer orientation and customer's loyalty intentions."

Results focus on two components: preparation and selling. In examining their relationships with organizational tenure, findings show that while prior experience in a manager's organization leads to higher levels of preparation, there is no relationship between experience and levels of issue selling. In addition, selling reported by the managers in the sample does not significantly influence issue-selling success. However, logistic regression results indicate that preparation is more than three times as likely to influence issue-selling success. The impact of contextual factors, the role of organizational culture, and the possibility of targeted training are also discussed within the framework of issue selling."

This study develops a comprehensive modeling framework for the mixed noise-driven shale gas-water supply chains, which is integrated with techniques of system dynamics model and two-stage stochastic risk-aversion programming. White and colored noises are used for addressing stochastic characterization of shale gas productivity. Regional water resources carrying capacity is reflected based on the system dynamics model. The developed model cannot only effectively address stochastic parameters in the objective and constraints, but also offer a linkage between the pre-regulated policies and corresponding economic implications raised from improper policies. A Marcellus-based case in Pennsylvania is then performed to validate the applicability of the developed model. Results reveal that shale gas production curve is more sensitive to colored and mixed noises than white noise. High flowback and recycle rates would increase carrying capacity of shale wells by 1.8% in 2023. An increase in weighting factor (e.g., from 0 to 30) would induce a rise in system cost (e.g., from $1.22×1011 to $1.34×1011) but a reduction in conditional value-at-risk value (e.g., from $6.83×1010 to $3.83×1010). Weighting factor thus can be served as an indicator to show how much the decision makers’ attention to system risk.

Transportation decisions have considerable direct impacts on urban society, both positive and negative, for example through changes in transit times and economic productivity, urban connectivity, tailpipe emissions and attendant air quality concerns, traffic accidents, and noise pollution. Much research has been dedicated to quantifying these direct impacts for various transportation modes. Transportation planning decisions also result in a variety of indirect environmental and human health impacts, a portion of which can accrue outside of the transit service area and so outside of the local decision-making process. Integrated modeling of direct and indirect impacts over the life cycle of different transportation modes provides decision support that is more comprehensive and less prone to triggering unintended consequences than a sole focus on direct tailpipe emissions."

This paper aims to investigate the role of ethnic-related outlet attributes in determining the attractiveness of mainstream and ethnic service outlets to ethnic consumers.Design methodology approach - Based on institutional theory and self-congruity theory, the paper proposes that two sets of outlet attributes, ethnic-related and performative attributes, influence the attractiveness of an outlet. These effects are mediated by a business's pragmatic legitimacy, its social legitimacy (in terms of perceived sensitivity to ethnic culture), and the congruity between the consumer's self-image and the business. A model is proposed and hypotheses derived. They are tested on data from an online survey among 483 Chinese Australian consumers about their use of travel agents. The hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling.Findings - The study reveals that ethnic-related attributes play a specific and significant role in determining outlet attractiveness for Chinese consumers in Australia. Although they have a smaller effect than service and price, ethnic-related attributes contribute positively to perceived attractiveness. Of the performative attributes, customer service has the largest effect; offering competitive prices has the second largest effect. Outlet accessibility has no significant effect while store atmosphere has an unexpected negative effect. Store atmosphere acts as both a performative and an ethnic-related attribute. The results confirm the hypothesized mediation effects of pragmatic legitimacy, social legitimacy and congruity.Originality value - This study contributes to a better understanding of ethnic consumer behaviour and the role of ethnic retail and service outlets in the market place. It provides new insights by drawing from different theoretical frameworks (institutional theory and self-congruity theory) and conducting an empirical study that uses validated scales in a unique setting among real consumers reporting about their use of a service provider. The results not only demonstrate the role and potential of ethnic attributes, but also how customer service and store atmosphere play a more intricate role than initially expected."

SomanSethuram2008Tobe,,Trade offs between environmental benefits provided by riparian buffers and agricultural production—implication for the Big Creek watershed,"Soman, Sethuram",2008,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"An integrative modeling approach (IMA) is developed to generate a trade off curve between agricultural production and ecosystem services at a farm level. The methodology involves integrating a evolutionary algorithm with a hydrologic model AGNPS, a composite wildlife index model, and an economic model. The methodology developed in this research will help to identify the shape (competitive, complementary or supplementary) of the PPF curve of economic returns and ecosystem services. The integrated model is capable of identifying the optimal combinations of agricultural production and ecosystem services based on the available technology and resources at a farm level. In this study a multi agent based model using evolutionary algorithms is been developed and utilized to identify the current performance level of farms based on existing policy and market conditions. This study captures various ecosystem services provided by agricultural landscapes with riparian buffers such as increased water quality and wildlife benefits. The integration of IMA and multi agent based model helps one to identify the trade offs in gross margin that is required to provide more ecosystem services at a farm level. This integration also helps to identify the possible improvement with respect to economic gain and ecosystem service production for each farm from the current level of production. The study is conducted on a subset of the Cache river watershed called the Big creek watershed. This comprehensive integrated modeling framework has important policy implications for the design of conservation stewardship programs such as the CRP, Conservation Security Program (CSP) and National Conservation Buffer Initiative (NCBI), which help target areas such as riparian buffers or land parcels that provide the maximum environmental benefits for the dollar spent. The anticipated results could serve as a tool in decision-making. This research offers interactive and spatially explicit models that will provide scientific information to policy makers and stakeholders that will aid in their planning and decision-making process regarding landuse decisions and their impacts on ecosystem services from various policy scenarios and market conditions."

In the current study, a process model was built using HSC Sim software, and metamodeling of the simulated flowsheet was conducted with the design of experiments (DOE), after which the basic functionality of the flowsheet was verified by experimental work, starting from sulfuric acid leaching of spent batteries. As the process is based on chemical circulation internally in the process, the objective was to investigate the accumulation of the elements in solution, specifically Na + , K + , SO 4 2− ions and impurities liberated in the NaOH conversion step. It was found out that metamodeling could be utilized in obtaining first estimate of the process behavior, prior to any experiments. Flowsheet functionality with circulated solution was confirmed, obtaining at best 96.9% La recovery."
HongXu2011LaUD,,Liquidity and Uncertainty Dependent Order Flow Effects in the Foreign Exchange Market: an Empirical Investigation : A Microstructure Approach to Exchange Rate Modeling,"Hong, Xu",2011,,,,,,,,,"In this thesis I try to model exchange rate fluctuations using microstructure theory. While the classical macroeconomic models of exchange rates have shown to have little or no support at frequencies higher than semiannual (Rime and Sojli, 2006), microstructure models have proved successful in explaining exchange rate movements in relative high frequent data (daily and weekly frequency). Recent literature have attempted to apply microstructure in order to explain exchange rate movements at longer horizons in order to fill the hole which macroeconomic models have proved unable to explain. Chinn and Moore (2010) used monthly data to show that order flow does have explanatory power for exchange rate fluctuations at this level as well. The authors also found cointegrating relationship between order flows and exchange rates, confirming that the effect of order flow is persistent. This thesis is an extension to the work done at this level of frequency. I utilize two microstructure models in order to explain monthly exchange rate fluctuations for four major exchange rates. Order flows are created from foreign exchange trade statistics published in the Treasury Bulletin. Since literature and theory have shown that the price impact of order flow is dependent on market conditions, I try to control for this variability by adjusting the order flows. Building on theoretical foundations explained in Killeen et al. (2006), I therefore choose to adjust the order flows for uncertainty and liquidity. Furthermore, an attempt to control for hedging by including net option positions into the models is also provided. The Johansen trace test is applied in order to test for cointegration relationships between order flows and exchange rates. The results obtained in this thesis show that adjusted order flow provides better in-sample fit compared with unadjusted order flow. The results also points towards an “undershooting” adjustment mechanism for the exchange rates as the long run price impact are larger than the short run impact. The thesis is organized in following manner; chapter 2 outlines two different approaches to exchange rate modeling, the classical way with macroeconomic “fundamentals” and the microstructure approach which highlights agents heterogeneity and information superiority. The role of order flow in this setting is explained and also why it is an important determinant for explaining exchange rate fluctuations. Also included are some important facts about the exchange rate market structure. Chapter 3 contains a brief, but intuitive explanation of the two models used in this thesis; the Portfolio Shift model and the Liquidity Shock model. Chapter 4 gives a thorough description of the data series used in this thesis. An explanation of how I create order flow series is also provided. Furthermore, the times series properties for the dataset are tested for and discussed. Chapter 5 presents the results found in this thesis. Section 5.1 deals with econometric results from the Portfolio Shift model with various sorts of proxies for order flow. Section 5.2 show results from Johansen cointegration testing for both the models. Vector Error Correction Models based on the Liquidity Shock model are also estimated for each of the exchange rates. Chapter 6 concludes and proposes some potential extensions to this thesis. Estimations and other econometric results in this thesis have been done with the statistical software EViews, version 7.1."

S., M. R. Ray, T. L. Campbell. 1993. The impact of perceived environmental uncertainty and perceived agent effectiveness on the composition of compensation contracts. Management Sci.

Here, we focus on a specific unexpected result of Umanath et al. who found evidence contradicting the theoretical prediction with respect to the impact of environmental uncertainty on the composition of compensation contracts. Umanath et al., in retrospect, offered an explanation for their unexpected finding based on an alternative theory under the same agency framework. Our results not only ratify the alternative explanation offered by Umanath et al., but also identify information symmetry/asymmetry as the contingent factor capable of reconciling the apparently contradicting predictions of the two agency-based theories used in this research."
RosonRoberto2015BPaV,,Bargaining Power and Value Sharing in Distribution Networks: A Cooperative Game Theory Approach,"Roson, Roberto and Hubert, Franz",2015,Networks and spatial economics,15,1,71-87,,,Springer US,Boston,"This paper introduces a novel methodology for analyzing bargaining games on network markets, which are markets where transactions occur by means of distribution networks (e.g., gas, electric energy, water, etc.). The overall economic surplus obtained in the market is distributed among all network agents the on the basis of their bargaining power, which in turn depends on a variety of factors: position of each agent (e.g., a country) in the network, reliability in the cooperation scheme (e.g., geo-political stability), existence of market distortions and availability of outside options (e.g., alternative energy sources). The method we propose, which is illustrated here through an application to a fictitious network structure, is based on a two-stage process: first, a network optimization model is used to generate payoff values under different coalitions and network structures; second, cooperative game solutions are identified. Any change in the network structure entails both a variation in the overall welfare level and in the distribution of surplus among agents, as it affects their relative bargaining power. Therefore, expected costs and benefits, at the aggregate as well as at the individual level, can be compared to assess the economic viability of any investment in network infrastructure. A number of model variants and extensions are also considered: changing demand, exogenous instability factors, market distortions, externalities and outside options."

This methodology is based on rough set theory, which is able to translate survey data into behavioural rules. The topic of rule induction has been extensively investigated in other fields and in particular in learning machine, where several efficient algorithms have been proposed. However, the peculiarity of the rough set approach is that the inconsistencies in a data set about consumer behaviour are not aggregated or corrected since lower and upper approximation are computed. Thus, we expect that rough sets theory is suitable to extract knowledge in the form of rules within a consistent theoretical framework of consumer behaviour."

An equally important function of the system is to support communication within an organisation by structuring and co-ordinating the actions performed by the organisations agents. These two roles of a business system may be represented in terms of business and process models, i.e. the separation of the declarative aspects from the procedural control flow aspects of the system. Although this separation of concerns has many advantages, the differences in representation techniques and focus of the two model types constitutes a problem in itself. The main contribution of this paper is a unified framework based on agent oriented concepts to facilitate the analysis and integration of business models and process models in e-Commerce in a systematic way. The approach suggested bridges the gap between the declarative and social/economic aspects of a business model and the procedural and communicative aspects of a process model. We illustrate how our approach can be used to facilitate integration, process specification, process pattern interpretation and process choreography."
EpsteinGilS.2006Tpor,,The politics of randomness,"Epstein, Gil S. and Nitzan, Shmuel",2006,Social choice and welfare,27,2,423-433,,,Springer Science + Business Media,NEW YORK,"Recent analysis of public policy is based on elaborate political-economic models. A major advantage of these useful models is that they have micro-foundations. Their main shortcomings are that they are usually based on drastic simplifications regarding the institutional setting and, more importantly, that the results they yield are not robust to the assumptions regarding the institutional setting, the policy space or the agents' preferences. An alternative reduced-form modeling is the public-policy lobbying contest. This model can be applied to public-policy determination in representative democracies. However, its main drawback is that the notion of contest success function (CSF), a crucial component of the contest model, does not have micro-foundations and, therefore, the random behavior of the government seems ad-hoc. In the present paper we propose a partial micro-foundation for the public-policy contest. The possible rationalization of random government behavior is illustrated in the case of the most commonly studied CSFs: the function associated with the all-pay auction and Tullock's lottery logit functions. We also clarify how stake asymmetry, lobbying-skill asymmetry and return to lobbying effort determine the relative desirability, from the government's point of view, of these CSFs."

However, there is no systematic and comprehensive review on formulation of multi-directional interactive systems, semi-empirical and data-driven models for online estimation of battery depreciations, stochastic based smart energy management framework through optimal design and smart control. In this study, a state-of-the-art review has been conducted, in respect to interactive energy sharing networks with electrochemical battery storages, from perspectives of battery degradation modelling development, smart energy management, single- and multi-objective optimisations, and energy flexibility enhancement. Advanced techniques are proposed for the multi-criteria performance enhancement of interactive energy sharing networks, including shared renewable energy within district communities, mobility-based spatiotemporal energy sharing, and multi-directional energy interaction modes. An in-depth and dialectical analysis has been provided to predict dynamic depreciation (calendar and cycling ageing) and lifetime on electrochemical battery storages, including semi-empirical and data-driven models. Heuristic smart control strategies are thereafter formulated, such as renewable-to-demand, grid-responsive and battery-protective control strategies. Afterwards, a comprehensive review is conducted on multi-objective optimisations from different stakeholders (such as prosumers, building owners, utility grid company, and policy-makers), together with strategies for multi-criteria decision making to help identify the ‘best of the best’ solution along the Pareto optimal front. The formulated multi-directional energy sharing systems, machine learning based data-driven model on battery degradation estimation, and smart energy management framework can promote renewable and sustainable energy networks in smart cities. •Grid-responsive strategy for techno-economic performance improvement.•A comprehensive review on synergic interactions on multi-energy systems.•A systematic review on battery degradation estimation and lifetime prediction.•Multi-objective optimisation with Pareto optimal front for optimal design.•Multi-criteria decision making with trade-off solutions for contractions."

Design/methodology/approach - The population of the survey comprised 593 accounting experts registered in Expert Associations from the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo, and the sample is made up of 102 valid questionnaires. Five judges and five accounting experts from Curitiba (state of Parana) were also interviewed. Through Structural Equation Modeling, the translation process indicated statistical significance, except in the relationship between human accounting actors, non-human actors and problematization. Findings - Based on this research, we concluded that the establishment of networks in the field of specialized accounting inspection depends on numerous translations between agents, since they have an impact on the performance of activities and the stabilization of relationships. The quality of the expert report and technical report and the competence of accounting experts were pointed out as performance indicators. Accounting experts and accounting experts assistant's experience, the period of experience and the relationship with judges were identified as drivers of stable and lasting relationships between specialized accounting inspection actors. Originality/value - The study is relevant given the lack of research involving the Actor-Network Theory and accounting, particularly Accounting Inspection, both nationally and internationally. Therefore, contribute to investigate how the actors interact, create and modify relationships, through the perception of accountants and judges."
Buet-GolfouseFrancois2024NMaC,,New Mathematical and Computational Methods for Machine Learning and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,"Buet-Golfouse, Francois",2024,,,,,,,UCL (University College London),,"This thesis concerns various aspects of robustness in machine learning, which refers broadly to the impact of certain modelling assumptions on a model’s quality. The topic is examined from various perspectives, ranging from theoretical statistics to applied modelling. The main message of the six chapters is that problem framing and the probabilistic properties of algorithms used in data science are crucial for inferring robust insights from data and models. The first part discusses two machine learning applications: classification and recommender systems. It answers an open question about the type of aleatoric uncertainty supporting the principle of margin maximisation for classification, establishing that heavy-tailed distributions do not fit this framework under certain conditions. For recommender systems, the focus is on designing a flexible method that can be applied to a range of use cases while being economical in terms of parameters, particularly for small and large datasets. The second part focuses on fairness in machine learning, exploring situations where there are trade-offs between objectives such as accuracy and equal opportunities for different groups based on protected characteristics. A framework based on probably approximately correct learning is proposed to address the challenge of generalising to new data, and group functionals are suggested as a simple approach to fairness in unsupervised learning algorithms. The third and final part considers situations where agents must optimise multiple conflicting objectives. New reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandit algorithms are proposed, allowing agents to learn policies over the space of trade-offs. The thesis also explores the idea that an agent’s preferences may change over time, which is particularly relevant to economic and financial problems such as optimal trade execution."
ROY1993AMOT,,A MODEL OF TRADE-FLOWS IN DIFFERENTIATED GOODS,"ROY and JOHANSSON, B",1993,The Annals of regional science,27,2,95-115,,,Springer Nature,NEW YORK,"In modelling trade competition for final products within a sector, the assumption of product homogeneity is often quite unrealistic. Even where the demand for different versions of the product can be attributed to relatively independent submarkets, considerable heterogeneity may still exist within each submarket. For each submarket, such as that for a medium-priced family car, it is assumed that more product heterogeneity exists between countries or regions than within them. Heterogeneity between regions is related to the existence of importers, acting as intermediate agents, who make trade-offs between cif import prices of goods and the willingness-to-pay by consumers. Aggregate spatial supply and demand functions based on plausible distributional assumptions are presented and estimated using a unified theoretical basis for each regional grouping of producers, importers and consumers. Conditions for simultaneous equilibrium for these three sets of agents are established, and illustrated via a small numerical example."
ShiXia1991MtCe,,Modeling the Chinese economy: In a general equilibrium framework,"Shi, Xia",1991,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"In this dissertation, an experimental multisectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is developed for the Chinese economy. CGE models, based on optimizing behaviors of economic agents in a decentralized economy, allow for a systematic investigation of the interdependences within and across sectors of the economy in production, consumption, factor utilization, and foreign trade. CGE models can also capture nonlinear substitution possibilities and input-output structure, and incorporate macro variables and mechanisms for achieving balance among national aggregates. A CGE model could be applied for a post-reform socialist economy where market mechanisms have been incorporated in commodity production and resource allocation decisions. China has undergone economic reform for the past decade, during which there have been many great institutional and distributional changes in its socioeconomic system. Applying a CGE model to the Chinese economy could help in the analysis of the economic reform, and contribute to knowledge of modeling research. This thesis begins with background on the Chinese economy and the economic reforms of the last decade, followed by a discussion of the applicability of a CGE model to the Chinese economy and a schematic description of the model for the Chinese economy. Then, a full mathematical specification of the model is presented, combining sophisticated CGE modeling techniques and traditional planning methodologies. Many structural features have been incorporated in the model to reflect many rigidities in China's reforming economy. Next, data sources and reconciliation, model estimation, and calibration are described in more detail. Base run results are further analyzed to examine the many structural imbalances and price system distortions that currently exist in the Chinese economy. Finally, the model is used for energy and foreign trade policy simulation and analysis."
JohnsonLiz2015Acfc,,A call for complexity: integrated models to solve complex policy problems,"Johnson, Liz",2015,Mind & society,14,2,259-271,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"This research calls for attention to complexity theory and the integration of complexity methodologies in policy research. A complexity approach in research practice requires a systems worldview and recognition of non-linearity, networks, self-organization, emergence, and feedback in policy. Simply, if a phenomenon is complex and can be explored from varied contexts and scales, the conceptual frame, and the methodical approach should be able to address the complexity. Complexity science has the capacity to account for complexity in varied contexts, on varied scales, and with an interrelated and interdependent environment. Further, if policy systems are at times simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic, then complexity mythologies combined with traditional qualitative and quantitative methods can bring to light the workings of the elusive black box. Complexity allows for triangulation of both linear and non-linear methodologies integrating qualitative, quantitative, network analysis, and agent-based models, as well as other methodologies. Complexity science is not the panacea to solve all policy problems with perfection. But if you do not acknowledge the complexity you will be missing out on the opportunity to shape patterns of sustainability, to effectively manage complex policy problems to someday solve them."

The invasive pathogen originated in Western Colombia/Ecuador. In recent years it has expanded its range in South America (Peru and Venezuela) and rampaged throughout Mesoamerica as far as Mexico. Africa, Asia, and insular Caribbean are still free of this pathogen. Thus, the full management cascade recommended for invasive plant pathogens is applicable at certain locations: prevention, early detection and rapid response, and impact mitigation using various control approaches. This paper presents key issues and prioritizes actions that need to be taken to manage this pathogen cost-effectively at the applicable intervention point(s): (1) Prevention • Public awareness and education • More efficient enforcement of existing regulations • Extreme alertness and regional cooperation in the insular Caribbean, Eastern Venezuela, French Guiana, the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, Brazil, and Bolivia • Strategic measures for intercontinental germplasm transfer, transport and trade (2) Early Detection and Rapid Response • Training of quarantine and survey personnel in early detection of latent infections • Anticipatory emergency plan, based on pathway risk analysis • Effective mechanism for prompt host elimination and compensation scheme (3) Impact Mitigation • Integrated approach, supplementing cultural control with chemical and biological agents • Design of disease-resilient agroforestry systems (both short term) • Classical biocontrol where introduced, e.g., with endophytes (medium term) • Genetic and induced resistance (long term) • Regular review of cost-effectiveness of measures, e.g., modelling for decisionmaking"

The reaction of car traffic to a certain planning scenario has been simulated by the DUE assignment technique and the positive impact of the modal shift on the objective function has been tackled by attaching a suitable weight to the time saving for bus passengers. The rise in the bus travel speed, owing to the bus lane solution, has been predicted for a set of urban roads by a neural network, so as to take into account many quantitative and qualitative road attributes.

GormanMichaelF.2012MI,,Management Insights,"Gorman, Michael F.",2012,Management science,58,3,iv-vi,,,INFORMS,HANOVER,"Robert C. Seamans How does government bailout of automotive and financial companies affect competition? Economists have long studied competition between profit maximizing firms. The author investigates how private firms respond to potential entry from public firms. Based on a data set of more than 3,000 U.S. cable TV systems, the author presents evidence consistent with the idea that cable firms actively try to deter entrance by municipal electricity utilities that may be considering offering cable services. Interestingly, the author points to evidence that incumbent cable TV firms upgrade faster when located in markets with a potential municipal entrant. However, it isn't necessarily for the good of its customers; the same systems are then slower to offer new products enabled by the upgrade. Incumbent cable systems also upgrade faster in response to municipal entry threats than to the threat of a private company entering the market. The insight for management: A private firm's response to potential entry from a public firm differs from its response to a threat from a private firm; government participation may spark a quicker and more defensive stance from incumbents. Michael B. Gordy, Søren Willemann A complex financial instrument called the constant proportion debt obligation (CPDO) might be viewed as the poster child for the excesses of financial engineering in the credit market. For example, one of the first CPDOs, ABN AMRO's Surf, was rated AAA by Standard and Poor's (S&P) and earned considerable attention in the financial press and industry awards such as Risk magazine's “Deal of the Year” in February 2007. However, when credit markets came under stress in 2007, CPDOs were among the first to unravel. The authors examine the CPDO as a case study in model risk in the rating of complex structured products. They show that the volatility of CPDOs was itself volatile and that it was common for risk models to underestimate the probability of extreme spread changes. The insight for management: Traditional risk models' estimates of high spread levels were biased downward, which in turn biased the rating upward. Gad Allon, Eran Hanany “May I go in front of you?” is a request often made in a bank or grocery line, followed by “I am in a huge hurry and will only take a second.” How do you respond? The authors explore both the decision to request to “cut” and the decision whether to grant or reject the request. They find that when no “authority” (e.g., bank manager) is involved, in some cases the answer is yes, in others, no. As it turns out, the eyes boring into the back of the “cutter” might be the best enforcement mechanism to reduce cutting. The insight for management: Your customers might “cut” only in certain situations; social policing may be an alternative to authority policing of customer behavior. Ravi Jagannathan, Srikant Marakani, Hitoshi Takehara, Yong Wang Have you checked your portfolio lately? The prevailing “consumption-based capital asset pricing model” (CCAPM) suggests that the risk premium that investors require to invest in a financial asset is proportional to the covariance of its return with the growth rate in aggregate per capita consumption, the measure of the security's systematic risk. The authors suggest that this model holds only at those points in time when all investors review their plans. They find more support for this theory at the end of the tax year in both Japan and the United Kingdom, when people are more likely to reevaluate their investment and consumption decisions. The insight for management: The assumption of full information is important for the CCAPM to hold. Vishal V. Agrawal, Mark Ferguson, L. Beril Toktay, Valerie M. Thomas Is leasing greener than selling? Based on the proposition that leasing is environmentally superior to selling, some firms have adopted a leasing strategy and others promote their existing leasing programs as environmentally superior to “green” their image. The argument is that because a leasing firm retains ownership of the off-lease units, it has an incentive to remarket them or invest in designing a more durable product, resulting in a lower volume of new production and disposal. However, leasing might be environmentally inferior because of the direct control the firm has over the off-lease products, which may prompt the firm to remove them from the market to avoid cannibalizing the demand for new products. The authors find that leasing can be environmentally worse despite remarketing all off-lease products and greener than selling despite the mid-life removal of off-lease products. They show that imposing disposal fees or encouraging remanufacturing, under some conditions, can actually lead to higher environmental impact. They also identify when educating consumers to be more environmentally conscious can improve the relative environmental performance of leasing. The insight for management: Leasing might sound green, but other alternatives might be more effective. James W. Taylor How many operators are needed to adequately staff a call center? The key input to the call center staffing decision is a forecast for the number of calls arriving. Typically, density forecasts that are inputs to analytical call center simulation models assume Poisson arrivals with a stochastic arrival rate. Often, Holt–Winters exponential smoothing forecasts adapted for modeling the intraday and intraweek cycles has been used. The author proposes a Poisson count model with a gamma distributed arrival rate forecasting method and tests his forecasting methodology using data from three organizations. The author evaluates forecast accuracy up to two weeks ahead and finds that the proposed models improve prediction beyond two days ahead. The insight for management: Improved forecasting methodologies can improve call center simulations to support staffing decisions. Stephen E. Chick, Peter Frazier Stop or shop? Say a manager is investigating a location for a new retail outlet or distribution center, for example. How does he know when to stop or to continue searching when there is great uncertainty of how each location will perform? How can a manager select “best” alternatives in an environment of future uncertainty of how the alternatives will perform? The authors suggest that “economics of selection” procedures help a manager facing a sequential sampling problem in which sampling is used to infer the unknown performance of several alternatives before one is selected as best. The manager compares a known standard with one alternative whose unknown reward is inferred with sampling. The insight for management: Sequential decision heuristics based on economics may account for the expected benefit of alternatives and may allow for adaptive stopping policies, saving time and effort. J. Michael Harrison, N. Bora Keskin, Assaf Zeevi Imagine that a bank makes loan decisions to consumers who call in sequentially, observing either success or failure in each sales attempt. Initially, the bank may not know the underlying willingness to pay, so each price decision involves a trade-off between learning (failed sale) and earning (successful sale, but potentially underpriced). Because learning is passive (that is, learning takes place only as a by-product of actions that have a different purpose), incomplete learning and poor long-run profit performance can result. The authors find that, in some cases, a myopic policy can work out. The insight for management: A rather myopic policy under this uncertainty has a bounded performance gap relative to that of perfect information as the number of sales attempts becomes large. Hart E. Posen, Daniel A. Levinthal It has been said that an organization must evolve or die. In fact, a common justification for organizational change is that the circumstances in which the organization finds itself have changed, thereby eroding the value of utilizing existing knowledge. On the surface, the claim that organizations should adapt by generating new knowledge seems obvious and compelling. However, this standard wisdom overlooks the possibility that the benefit of learning may itself be eroded if change is an ongoing property of the environment. Any collected information has costs—but no benefits—as the information becomes obsolete. The insight for management: Under some conditions the appropriate response to environmental change is a renewed focus on exploiting existing knowledge and opportunities rather than a costly pursuit of new information that may itself be obsolete. Ilia Tsetlin, Robert L. Winkler The “one-switch” property states that the preference between any two lotteries switches at most once as wealth increases. The authors extend the one-switch notion to the multiattribute case and identify the families of multiattribute utility functions that are also one-switch. The insight for management: The one-switch property, when appropriate, can simplify the assessment of multiattribute utility. Sanjiv Erat, Vish Krishnan Recently, the Swiss-based nongovernmental organization Mabawa posed the Rwanda Rural Electrification Challenge in “tournament” fashion, with the top three solutions splitting $2,500. Would you participate? Such an unstructured problem is costly to specify, poses credibility issues for the focal firm, and requires finely tuned awards for meeting the firm's needs. The firm must go through extensive efforts in these regards to attract participants and useful solutions. The authors suggest how a firm should effectively manage such open-ended design contests by examining the relationship among problem specification, award structure, and breadth of solution space searched by outside agents. The authors explain an interesting phenomenon observed in design contests: clustering of searchers in specific regions of the solution space. Although the breadth of search increases with the number of searchers, the growth of the solution space is slower than th"

The paper focuses on comparing two modelling approaches. The first is based on optimizing agents, endowed with social preferences, their utility being the sum of private consumption and moral utility. The second approach involves agents acting according to simple heuristics. While the traditionally shaped Laffer curves are encountered in the optimizing model, the heuristics models exhibit (linearly) increasing Laffer curves. This difference is related to a peculiar type of behaviour: within the agent-based approach lurk a number of agents in a moral state of limbo, alternating between altruism and selfishness.

In this scenario, a market structure based on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactions is very promising but presents challenges for the network operation. A critical challenge is to ensure that network constraints are not violated due to energy trades between peers and neither due to the use of reserve capacity. In this paper, it is proposed a new iterative sequential approach for energy and reserve P2P market that ensures the feasibility of both energy and reserve transactions under network constraints. The methodology considers the interaction between the prosumers and the Distribution System Operator (DSO) in making the final market/operation decision and can be integrated into the existing distribution system. The proposed approach includes the estimation of reserve requirements based on the RES uncertain behavior from historical generation data, which allows identifying RES patterns. The proposed model is assessed through a case study that uses a 14-bus system, under the technical and economic criteria. The results show that the approach can ensure a feasible network operation encompassing energy and reserve markets. •An optimization approach to integrate prosumer and DSO for energy and reserve market solution.•Inclusion of electrical network constraints into the energy and reserve market problem.•Obtaining feasible results under both the energy and electrical network constraints.•Modeling uncertainties over distributed renewable energy sources through historical generation data.•Evaluation of the reserve calculation from two probabilistic algorithms."

FosterGigi2017Bpe,,Behavioral political economy,"Foster, Gigi and Frijters, Paul",2017,,,,348-364,,,Routledge,,"A major element in the success of economics is its production of simple ideas to describe many complex phenomena. Crudely speaking, mainstream economists view the world as made up of optimizing actors looking to become as wealthy as possible within the rules of the game set down by a political process. Consequently, approximating perfect markets as closely as possible is the means by which a society can achieve the greatest overall welfare from the natural competition between individuals. Economists, therefore, analyze situations in terms of their divergence from perfect markets; for example, because of asymmetric information, missing markets, returns to scale, limited property rights, and/or market power. Economists then rely on implicit rules of thumb about what can be done to overcome market imperfections, such as 'seek to reduce entry barriers', 'promote public access to trade-relevant information', and 'avoid concentrations of market power'. Feasible interventions based on such rules of thumb might include public oversight over natural monopolies, contract enforcement, managing interest rates and the money supply, setting up new property rights, creating markets, and so forth."

Based upon a number of field studies the notion of information needs is reconsidered and combined with concerns for information literacy, social autonomy and the role of indigenous knowledge. The authors then present a number of examples of innovative approaches to the delivery of information services that may support the role of information centers and libraries as change catalyst from within the communities rather than mere providers of ready made information.Findings - To this end, information professionals have to be educated in order to become change agents and consider this role as essential for their practice to be rewarding for themselves and more importantly for the people they serve. There are numerous examples of information services and information professionals who make a difference in the life of their communities against the most severe circumstances. This however requires a radical shift in their value system and operation.Originality value - The authors hope that the paper will encourage information professionals and in first place those who educate them to give social responsibility toward disadvantaged communities the same emphasis and priority as alignment with the latest technological artifact or excellence in observance of standards."

Prior to launching this rapid program, call center managers were concerned about the difficulty of meeting a proposed guarantee to paying customers that they would wait less than one minute on hold. Managers also wanted to know how the new program would affect the service provided to their existing base of regular, nonpaying customers. We quickly developed an animated simulation model that addressed these concerns and gave the managers a good understanding for the impact on system performance of changes in the number of customers purchasing the rapid program and in the number of agents. The one-minute guarantee would be fairly easy to achieve, even if the percentage of callers in the rapid program became quite high. Managers also gained confidence that, with appropriate staffing levels, they could successfully implement the new program, which they soon did."

PereraHewageLoshakaKumara2019Dtot,,Determining the optimum toll level for freight vehicles in urban conditions,"Perera, Hewage Loshaka Kumara",2019,,,,,,,,,"Road pricing has been a very common practice in the world for many decades. Tolls are charged from road users as a tool to control traffic (congestion) or to raise finance (to recover capital and maintenance cost) or to control emissions. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) or Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) schemes have become common sources of financing infrastructure projects in many countries and tolls are collected to recover the cost. Private investors are attracted to such investments due to the potential opportunity to make high returns. On the contrary, the public has accepted private investments due to its transparency and rapid nature of construction compared with government authorities. However, in the operational stage, the public is more concerned about factors such as air quality, safety, and noise whereas investors are mostly concerned about the return on investment, which are in conflict. Nevertheless, toll levels appear to be set for maximizing profits ignoring many public concerns and other related issues. Road prices are charged usually to recover pavement damage costs, road maintenance costs, capital costs, congestion costs, marginal savings, and emission costs. Regardless of the intended objective of charging vehicles on road, many studies in the past have looked at how various road pricing policies would change the behaviour of car traffic. But limited studies have been carried out identifying its impacts towards freight user behaviour. Demand for freight movement is increasing day to day as populations’ increase, especially in urban cities, which makes them significant. There were only a few studies carried out in the past to study the behaviour of freight vehicles, especially how they respond to toll charges. It was found that toll avoiding nature of freight vehicles increases the social and environmental costs. City logistics is a concept which looks at total optimization of freight movement in city limits. City logistics consider system optimisation not limited to economic aspects, but also social and environmental. Freight vehicles are known to produce more externalities compared to cars, especially in city limits, where average speeds are low and most congested. As a result, freight vehicles in urban conditions produce more externalities such as crashes, noise, emissions, and it was found that conditions are getting worst due to toll avoiding nature of freight movement. Determining optimum toll charges for freight vehicles are crucial decisions for policymakers considering socio-economic aspects. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a mathematical approach to design an optimal toll scheme for multi-class vehicles, considering direct costs and externalities. A bi-level modeling approach is used, where toll prices for multi-class vehicles are decided in the upper level and user response to toll charges are predicted using user equilibrium (UE) conditions with multi-class traffic assignment in the lower level. In the upper level of the model development total cost calculation is an important component and thus a freight cost model was developed for Australia. For the cost model, local data were used when possible and gaps were filled from literature. In the lower level, the response to toll charges was embedded to user equilibrium conditions. A discrete choice experiment was carried out to find out how freight vehicles would respond to toll charges in Melbourne. This NP-hard, non-convex problem with non-linear constraints was solved using multi-objective optimisation. A Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was used for optimisation. The model is applied to a small hypothetical road network and a real network in Melbourne with static demand conditions. Several applications of the model were performed considering various stakeholder objectives and optimal solutions were identified for enhancing City Logistics. As an application, an effective toll charging scheme to minimize total network vehicular emissions while maintaining reasonable revenue for investors was found using the bi-level modeling approach. The model takes into consideration both toll revenue and total vehicle operating costs to produce an acceptable solution for both investors and road users. All major components of hazardous emissions (CO2, PM2.5, SO2 and NOx) were considered and estimated using an emission costs model developed based on secondary data quantifying their impact on human health and the environment. Application of the model was illustrated using two networks mentioned above. Since this is a single objective optimisation, genetic algorithm was used to find near-optimal solutions for each toll-charging scenario. The results revealed that commonly used toll schemes are inefficient with respect to multi-stakeholder objectives. The toll charging scheme optimized using the GA was able to reduce the total emission cost of the network by 12% compared to a toll scheme currently used by a toll facility in a real network in Melbourne, Australia. In the next section of this study, the toll problem is viewed from a different angle. As mentioned before toll roads constructed under public-private-partnerships (PPP) is very common around the world and due to the high capital cost invested and high risks associated with subsequent returns, investors are extremely concerned about future returns. As a result, the present trend is to charge high tolls for freight vehicles, especially in urban areas, which has created many problems as mentioned above. Considering the overall impacts, this section of the study identifies a tolling scheme with subsidies as the best option to minimize the total cost of urban freight transport which can lead to more sustainable city logistics in the future. A step by step process is followed in this study with illustrations to explore the best toll charging scheme considering various toll scenarios within a multi-objective framework. Acceptability of toll schemes found in this study by multi-stakeholders is a critical decisive factor determining successful implementation of toll schemes. Multi-Agent Multi-Criteria Analysis was used to evaluate the various toll schemes produced from this study under various conditions. Surveys were carried out to collect the required information to feed the MAMCA. Finally, the best toll alternatives are ranked based on MAMCA outcome which can be used by policy decision makers considering the given conditions. Source: TROVE"

The REA modeling framework belongs to value oriented perspective modeling tools rather than to process oriented perspective modeling tools. Its prevailing application area has been accountancy domain. The aim of the paper is to utilize this framework also to other standard domains. Enterprise production planning at operational level is an important part of business process modeling. The paper gradually utilizes value chain oriented approach to the issue. The results are illustrated on the included figures. Then the basic concepts and relationships of the REA modeling framework are described and illustrated. The REA modeling framework distinguishes between two elementary processes. They are the exchange process, mostly used in the areas of sales and purchases and the conversion process meaning creation of some new materials or goods. The most important part of the paper is a creation of simple enterprise production planning model. The production planning model is based on the resource reservations. That is why the extended REA ontology had to be introduced with commitments and reservations. In the conclusion the main advantages of the REA model approach are emphasized. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"
GabrieliTommaso2007BARP,,BELIEFS AND REDISTRIBUTIVE POLITICS UNDER INCOMPLETE INFORMATION,"Gabrieli, Tommaso",2007,,,,,,,,,"The reason why the social contract is so different in two otherwise comparable societies like the United States and continental Western European countries represents a challenging question. Large empirical evidence shows that the difference in the political support for redistribution appears to reflect a difference in the social perceptions regarding the determinants of individual wealth and the underlying sources of income inequality. I present a model of beliefs and redistribution which explains this evidence through multiple politico-economic equilibria. Differently from the recent literature which obtains multiple equilibria by modeling agents characterized by psychological biases, my model is based on standard assumptions. Multiple equilibria originate from multiple optimal levels of information for the society. Multiple optimal levels of information exist because increasing the informativeness of an economy produces a trade-off between a decrease in adverse selection and an increase in moral hazard. The framework allows the analysis of various comparative statics in order to answer to policy questions."

Best Company,Oldwick,"Predictive modeling, market data and related improvements in information technology have enabled property/casualty insurers to price their products with a far greater degree of sophistication and precision than in the past. What has not kept pace, however, is the commission-based business-relationship with agents for distribution of personal-lines products. Carriers, given their predictive modeling, can project with much greater certainty than in the past which types of insureds will be most profitable, how long they are expected to renew with the carrier, and whether there are many cross-selling opportunities. Therefore, they could pay commissions that vary according to these projections. Clearly, property/casualty companies have some opportunities to put into place more effective relationships with their agents, if they are willing to explore some new distribution approaches that take greater advantage of their own resources and capabilities."

The main objective of the PSA is to provide capabilities for the testing and evaluation of sequences of actions in domains characterized by unavoidable uncertainties and difficult trade-offs between resources and objectives. The representation language, called action networks, is a semantically well founded framework for reasoning about actions and change under uncertainty based on probabilistic Bayesian networks. Action networks add primitives to Bayesian networks to represent canonical models of time-dependencies, and controllable variables to represent agents manipulations of the domain. In addition, action networks allow different methods for quantifying the uncertainty in causal relationships, which go beyond traditional probabilistic quantification. Inferences are performed via a set of algorithms for approximate computation of belief update, allowing the user to trade-off computational time for accuracy of the answer.< >"

By offering an illustration comparing a workers compensation program without a deductible to one with a deductible, a good insurance/risk management team can illustrate that, over time, the client could be better served by one or the other. By adding incurred losses and the degree of accuracy (standard deviation) regarding the prediction of future losses, the risk manager and agent will have a highly effective tool suitable for guiding short-term decision making and longterm predictive modeling. [...]the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has been around since 1968. Working together, the agent/broker and risk manager team can provide solutions that will ultimately facilitate commerce that delivers greater value to the buyer, and isn't that what is really most important? ?

PuzzelloDaniela2005MaA,,Matching and Anonymity,"Puzzello, Daniela",2005,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This dissertation provides theoretical underpinnings for exogenous matching frameworks. The ultimate goal is to improve our understanding of economies whose functioning is impaired by frictions of spatial, informational or institutional nature. Indeed, there is a well established research program in economics that deals with the efficiency of allocations in environments where trade is subject to frictions. The desire of making trading frictions explicit is often reflected in the assumption of matching and trading in small coalitions. Establishing a comprehensive approach to modeling matching is crucial because the economic literature's treatment of matching---intended as a technology---is mostly descriptive and hazily formalized. These shortcomings contribute to make cloudy the precise connections between the constraints imposed by the matching technology, the environmental frictions and the possible allocations. This study is organized into three chapters that provide a fully integrated theoretical approach to matching frameworks by applying set-theoretic concepts and other sophisticated tools of mathematical analysis. The first chapter is meant to lay the groundwork by considering as a point of reference any physical environment with technologies that exogenously pair agents in a deterministic manner. It is a first step in developing a unified framework to study matching processes in infinite horizon economies populated by an arbitrary set of infinitely lived agents. It formalizes the link between matching and informational constraints by developing a notion of anonymity that is based on agents' matching histories. Furthermore, it defines an exact map between properties of the matching process and the degrees of informational openness (i.e., the degrees of anonymity). The second and third chapters build on the first to explore matching and anonymity in richer environments. The second chapter formalizes the method of operation of multilateral matching. Finally, the third chapter analyzes random matching. By developing a comprehensive theoretical approach to matching, this study is an initial step in contributing to building more solid foundations for research centered around the study of allocations in decentralized trading environments."
LloretBatlleRoger2017PaCC,,Peer-to-Peer and Collaborative Consumption of Supply in Transportation Systems,"Lloret Batlle, Roger",2017,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Transportation systems have been traditionally operated on a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) fashion. FCFS consumption of supply occurs because it is accepted as a natural paradigm when the operators have no individual-specific information that allows consideration of any other serving order, and when users are assumed not to communicate among themselves. Thus, FCFS behaves as a status quo policy that is generally considered as fair, since it is presumed that all users are treated equally. We know though, that there exists heterogeneity in users' valuation of time and delay savings, and that the values may be different in different situations even for the same user. Taking advantage of smartphones and connected vehicle environments, it is now possible to include this user heterogeneity into operations in order to increase overall system efficiency and fairness, where efficiency refers to satisfaction of users. There are then possibilities of accomplishing this through exchanges among users with appropriate pricing, which can be determined by the users themselves to their satisfaction, so as to determine the order and extent of the utilization of supply. This new operational paradigm leads to collaborative consumption of supply. This dissertation explores the idea of violating FCFS by allowing users to trade in real-time the part of supply that they effectively “own” while they are in a transportation system. This de-facto ownership originates from the space-time region which each user rightfully controls, either due to their physical presence or due to reservations such as after purchasing a future trip from an operator. Attempting to answer the question of what pricing scheme would be fair and acceptable, leads this dissertation to introduce for the first time in transportation literature, the fundamental economic concept of envy-freeness. It can be taken as a pricing scheme as well as a user-behavior model. A resource allocation is said to be envy-free, when no agent feels any other agent's allocation to be better than their own, at the current price. An extension called dynamic envy-freeness is then developed for use in the domain of dynamic problems that the transportation field invariable pose, and a new family of envy-minimizing criteria are developed, namely the Constant Elasticity of Substitution Envy Intensity (CESEI) criteria, which strongly fits into the existing axiomatic body of Welfare Economics. Several applications of collaborative consumption that breaks FCFS ordering are explored in this dissertation. First, the dissertation develops PEXIC, Priced EXchanges in Intersection Control, in which users can pay other users to reduce their waiting delays in a fair manner. This system is shown to be Pareto-efficient, envy minimizing and financially self-sustainable. Second, it studies new operational policies in highway control: parallel queue routing policies for bottleneck situations where the vehicles' lane-queue selections are the results of trades, and queue-jumping operations for exit lanes where vehicles can take forward spots in a queue by paying the overtaken vehicles in a fair fashion that achieves queue stability. Third, it proposes Peer-to-peer (P2P) ride exchange in ridesharing systems, in which trip property rights are transferred to users in such a way that they can trade their rides between each other. Finally, the dissertation models a P2P ridesharing system as a dual role market exchange economy, introducing a truthful pricing scheme which includes High-Occupancy-Vehicle (HOV) lane savings and uses a novel min-cost max flow formulation that guarantees users a ride-back, a complementarity in preferences never explored before. The research does not attempt any elaborate examination of the social equity implications of such exchange-based systems with non-FCFS operations, but identifies some of such key issues and presents pointers for further study. It does not purport to take an advocacy position on transforming the transportation system operations to the newer paradigms, nor does it examine all the regulatory complications. The research does, however, demonstrate through modeling and analysis results from a variety of applications, that better system efficiency and user satisfaction can be achieved with the use of the proposed paradigms."

Responding to the stipulations by the US Federal Maritime Commission, any shipping agent transporting to the US must satisfy a minimum quantity of containers. To insure this MQC for shipping agents, the Royal Philips Electronics Company, with a large number of shipping needs, has to assign enough containers to each selected shipping agent to transport cargos to the US. This restriction creates difficulties for Philips as the company seeks to satisfy its shipping needs with minimum total costs. To solve this problem, we first formulate it by a mixed-integer programming model. In order for both linear programming relaxation and Lagrangian relaxation to provide good lower bounds, we then strengthen the model by a few valid inequalities. Furthermore, a Lagrangian-based heuristic and a branch and cut solver are applied to solve the problem. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of all the models and methods."

Travel behaviour modelling is increasingly disaggregate, econometric, dynamic, and behavioural. A fully dynamic approach to urban system modelling is described, where interactions are characterized as two agents interacting through discrete events labelled as ""offer"" or ""accept"". This leads to a natural partition of an integrated urban model into submodels based on the category of what is being exchanged, the type of agent, and the time and place of interaction. Where prices (or price-like signals such as congested travel times) exist to stimulate supply and/or to suppress demand, the dynamic change in prices can be represented either behaviourally, as individual agents adjust their expectations in response to their personal history and the history of the modelled region, or with an ""auctioneer"" from micro-economic theory, who adjusts average prices. When no auctioneers are used, the modelling system can use completely continuous representations of both time and space. Two examples are shown. The first is a demonstration of a continuous-time continuous-space transaction simulation with simple agents representing businesses and households. The second shows how an existing model-the Oregon TLUMIP project for statewide land-use and transport modelling-can be adapted into the paradigm."

BrughmansTom2022WSRE,,Why Simulate Roman Economies?,"Brughmans, Tom",2022,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,Oxford,"This introductory chapter explores the question of why a book on the topic of simulating Roman economies is needed at all. It aims to provide the common ground that simulation studies of the Roman economy need in order to contribute constructively to our understanding of this complex past phenomenon. It does this by describing and supporting seven claims, illustrated by using the chapters of this book as examples. Claim 1: formal modelling and computational simulation are necessary techniques for explicitly representing (aspects of) our complicated theories, and for testing them against historical and archaeological evidence. Claim 2: complex systems simulation is the only suitable approach for identifying emergent properties in complex systems. Claim 3: the Roman economy was a highly complex system. Theories describing this system are necessarily extremely complicated. Claim 4: building complicated models is a step-by-step cumulative process, where simplification is key. Claim 5: simulation should be integrated as one of our tools of the trade. This is an addition to and enrichment of current practice; it is not in conflict with current practice. Claim 6: there are many different and competing views on the nature of the Roman economy. Simulation studies will enhance constructive multivocality of these theoretical debates. Claim 7: good simulation studies of the Roman economy necessarily rely on collaboration across specialisms (where simulation is a specialism in the same way as ceramology or osteology). Encouraging this means integrating the basics of simulation approaches into education in classical studies."

However, it is quite difficult to define which of the learning mechanisms is the best. When considering the case of a cross-cultural environment, it is necessary to evaluate how adaptation to different cultures occurs while keeping, at some level, the cultural diversity among the groups. This paper focuses on identifying an evaluation criterion using a comparison of various learning mechanisms that can manage the trade-off between adaptation to a new culture and the preservation of cultural diversity. Results show that: (a) For small and gradual accuracy from a less accurate learning mechanism, there is a tiny reduction in the diversity while the convergence time drops rapidly. For an accuracy level close to the most accurate learning mechanism, a reduction of the convergence time can be minor, while the diversity drops rapidly; (b) The evaluation of learning mechanism that performs better for fast converging while simultaneously keeping a good diversity before the convergence was performed graphically."
SpeelmanErikaN2014GaSt,,Gaming and Simulation to Explore Resilience of Contested Agricultural Landscapes,"Speelman, Erika N",2014,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Over the past decades, smallholder farming communities have become increasingly affected by the (unexpected) impacts of globalization and economic and institutional change. Resilience thinking and complex adaptive systems theory provided new perspectives for analyzing processes of change in social-ecological systems such as smallholder agricultural landscapes. The capacity of agricultural communities to develop resilient systems and adapt to social-ecological change is key in securing the continuation of livelihoods in rural parts of the world. Improving the adaptive capacity of rural communities has been proposed as the largest challenge of the century, especially in contested areas were the interests of non-local stakeholders often strongly conflict with those of local communities. Against this background the objective of this thesis was to explore and apply concepts of resilience theory to contested agricultural landscapes in particular the concept of adaptive capacity, by means of innovative gaming and simulation methodologies to facilitate (social) learning related to these concepts. This thesis was based on 1) a comprehensive research in the usufruct community Tierra y Libertad (TyL) in the buffer zone of a Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. This community was specifically selected as a case study for this research for its history in the context of contested agricultural landscapes and pre-identified signs of adaptation, and 2) a series of workshops in which distinct gaming and simulation tools were explored with a variety of stakeholders and students. In this thesis, four gaming and/or simulation tools were developed and implemented to explore resilience and related concepts in contested agricultural landscapes and to assess their capacity as (social) learning tools towards more resilient agricultural landscapes.In chapter 2, a comprehensive reconstruction of local land-use and social organizational change in TyL was developed. This detailed reconstruction identified that the main drivers of change originated from global change processes. These were: (1) Strong decrease in maize price due to the implementation of neoliberal policies and the ratification of North America Free Trade Agreement, and (2) Land-use limitations resulting from the establishment of the La Sepultura MAB reserve connected to the initiation of active nature conservation policies at the National level. Initial responses were identified as short-term coping mechanisms characterized by large-scale land conversions and temporary outmigration (between 1990 and 2000). Gradually coping mechanisms were replace by more sophisticated adaptation strategies based on e.g. improved social organization and land use diversification (1995-2010). The circumstances that allowed for the development of adaptation were the long-term support of a neutral agency that bridged the gap between interests of the community and of non-local actors together with ample forest resources and a highly motivated community.In chapter 3, a stylized yet complex land-use board game rich in ecological and social outcomes was developed to (i) actively involve farmers in the process of agroecosystem design, and (ii) to identify factors and patterns of communal decision-making through an in-depth analysis of game strategies deployed by participants. Results of four pilot sessions with the RESORTES board game in TyL showed that the game sessions actively involved participants in discussions on landscape planning in the game and in real-life. Participants especially appreciated that the game sessions facilitated the engagement of stakeholders that were new to active involvement in communal decision-making. It allowed participants to openly discuss and share their ideas. Results of an ex-ante/ex-post analysis identified communication, leadership and relatedness among participants as influential factors that smoothened the collective decision-making process in the four pilot sessions.In chapter 4 and 5, two computer simulation tools were developed to facilitate (social) learning on concepts related to sustainable management for resilient multi-actor agricultural landscapes. The Agrodiversity v.2 model was developed to enable learning on the concept of functional agrodiversity (chapter 4). Users are challenged to explore ecological parameters of a small agroecosystem in a field with a perennial crop and design a productive sustainable system and experience that a proper balance between the coexisting species is necessary so that their ecological interactions allow the multi-species system to become self-organized and persist over time. More than a hundred university students in Mexico, Indonesia and the Netherlands, self-reported that they gained indepth knowledge through exploring the model. An in-depth analysis on the effects of using Agrodiversity v.2 on actual learning was performed by comparing between the knowledge of students after a normal lecture and after an additional interactive session with the Agrodiversity v.2 model in a workshop with 24 students. Results showed that students increased the quality of their answers to paper-based individual questions on the topic from 29% to 86% after the simulation session. On average students stated to have learnt 55% of their current knowledge through the workshop of which 76% was learnt by using the simulation.The program “Negotiated Design of Sustainable Production Systems among Social Agents with Conflicting Interests” was developed to enable learning on resilience thinking concepts such as stable and unstable equilibria, and non-linear responses (chapter 5). The program was developed as an interactive workshop for groups of participants in which participants learn through computer simulation explorations, role-play and negotiation sessions. In three acts, the participants take on different roles. participants take on the role of small-scale maize growers that face the need to intensify their production. Through computer simulations they explore the effects of nitrogen fertilizer application on their production, in act 1. In act 2, participants take on the role of rural families that live of tourism of a lake downhill from the maize farmers. They are confronted with lake eutrophication due to nitrogen fertilizer application of the maize growers. The participants explore the eutrophication process and the dynamics of the bi-stable lake ecosystem. In act 3, the group of participants is split to play out a group of farmers and lakeside households. They negotiate possible solutions using simulation explorations. Results from 12 workshops with the program were analysed and showed that participants improved their knowledge and understanding on the systems attributes: productivity, stability, resistance, resilience, reliability, adaptability and equity. In all workshops, participants managed to balance the biodiversity conservation and rural livelihood interests of all stakeholders involved through the development of creative solutions. Participants were challenged by concepts such as bi-stability, thresholds, risk, catastrophic shift, and hysteresis, but all stated that the program enabled them to learn about these concepts.In chapter 6 the LUSES model and its first steps of development were presented. The LUSES model aimed to contribute to the growing literature on social-ecological systems modelling through the development of a ABM tool to analyze land-use dynamics in agricultural landscapes based on social-psychological theory on individual decisionmaking. A qualitative validation exercise between simulated and empirical data from the study area, the smallholder farming community Tierra y Libertad, in Chiapas, Mexico, showed that real-life farmers and farming agents responded in a qualitative similar manner to economic and institutional change. The simulated data suggested that agents increased the importance of satisfying the existence need, which relate to economic dimensions of existence, when systems were under economic pressure. Simulated price increases resulted in minor land use changes, whereas price decreases corresponded with larger land us change. Although this first exercise points to a need of further model development, the results obtained so far support the implementation of social-psychological theory in modelling land-use dynamics in agricultural landscapes. Decision-making processes based on social-psychological theory appear to be (more) suitable for exploring responses to unknown future changes than rule-based methods derived from past decisions.Finally in chapter 7, the main findings of the thesis were discussed in a broader context of resilience of contested agriculture and tools to explore resilience and facilitate learning on resilience related concepts. This thesis contributed to the emerging literature on the exploration and application of resilience thinking to contested agricultural landscapes by presenting empirical evidence on the development of adaptive capacity in a reserve community. In addition, methodological and empirical insights on the development and exploration of gaming and simulation tools to actively involve stakeholders in social learning processes on landscape planning are provided. This thesis proposed future lines of research to identify the diversity of views of stakeholders on system resilience and to address conflicting views of local and non-local stakeholders through gaming and simulation."
ShiZhan2014Raaa,,"Risk, ambiguity, and anomalies in the fixed income market","Shi, Zhan",2014,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This dissertation contains five essays on the implications of risks and ambiguity for asset pricing puzzles, especially in the fixed income market. The first essay studies the effects of time-varying Knightian uncertainty (ambiguity) on equilibrium asset prices; the second and third essays focus on the term premia in the nominal and real Treasury bond markets; The last two examine the performance of structural models of credit risk in explaining the levels and changes of corporate yield spreads. In the first essay, I consider a continuous-time Lucas exchange economy in which an ambiguity-averse agent applies a discount rate that is adjusted not only for the current magnitude of ambiguity but also for the risk associated with its future fluctuations. As such, both the ambiguity level and volatility help raise asset premia and accommodate richer dynamics of asset prices. With a novel measure for the ambiguity level, I show that the estimated model is able to explain a wide range of asset markets anomalies, including the equity premium puzzle, the risk-free rate puzzle, the credit spread puzzle, and the expectations puzzle. In particular, this paper establishes both theoretical and empirical linkages of ambiguity with the unspanned predictability in the Treasury market. Furthermore, the proposed ambiguity measure is found to exhibit significant predictive power for excess returns on equities and bonds as well as for corporate yield spreads, a finding that justifies uncertainty channels highlighted in the model. The remaining four essays are based on work that is coauthored with Professor Jingzhi Huang. In the second chapter, we provide new and robust evidence on the power of macro variables for forecasting bond risk premia by using a recently developed model selection method-the supervised adaptive group ""least absolute shrinkage and selection operator"" (lasso) approach. We identify a single macro factor that can not only subsume the macro factors documented in the existing literature but also can substantially raise their forecasting power for future bond excess returns. In the third essay, we document a number of new empirical findings about the dynamic behavior and economic determinants of risk premia on real bonds. Specifically, we find that the real bond risk premium changes over time and fluctuates between positive and negative values. We also find that the real term structure itself contains a component that drives risk premia but is undetectable from cross section of bond yields. In addition, we present evidence on the link between real bond premia and macroeconomic variables. More specifically, we find that macro factors associated with real estate and consumer income and expenditure can capture a large portion of forecastable variation in excess returns on real bonds. The fourth essay provides new insights into the equity-credit market integration puzzle. Empirical evidence has documented that while variables suggested by structural credit risk models can explain only a small portion of corporate bond spread changes (Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin 2001), these models provide quite accurate predictions of hedge ratios for corporate bond returns (Schaefer and Strebulaev 2008). These two stylized facts together are often considered to have conflicting implications for the level of integration between equity and credit markets—given the fundamental relationship between corporate bond spread changes and returns. we provide a rational explanation of this anomaly by demonstrating that the two aforementioned seemingly conflicting findings can be reconciled with each other within the standard structural modeling framework. In particular, we show empirically that sensitivities of spread changes to leverage ratio or equity predicted by the Merton (1974) model are not rejected in time-series tests—namely, the Merton hedge ratios for spread changes are too consistent with data. That is, the equity-credit market integration puzzle can be explained from a traditional hedging perspective. In the last essay, we empirically examine the hedging performance of structural models using data on corporate bond transaction prices over the period July 2002–December 2012 from the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) database. While there is a large literature on the pricing performance of structural credit risk models, there is little empirical evidence on the empirical performance of these models on hedging corporate bonds.

Simulations show that temporary increases of world trade and higher value-added tax rates do not affect the equilibrium unemployment rate in the long run.

PathomdanaiPonjan2014D‘ad,,Developing ‘travelthai’: a dynamic Computable general equilibrium model for tourism of Thailand and case applications on tourism setbacks and tourism-related fiscal policies,Pathomdanai Ponjan and Yinhua Mai and Xiujian Peng,2014,,,,,,,,,"This thesis is aimed to develop a Monash-style medium-scale dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Tourism of Thailand as the major contribution. The model is designed to be capable of analyzing not only the economic policies but also historical simulation and forecasting simulation. The comparative static version of the ‘THORANI’ model is first developed and later on improved it into the dynamic version of the ‘TRAVELTHAI’ model that comprises dynamic capability. TRAVELTHAI’s modeling structure is based upon the MyAGE and McHuge, which are successors of MONASH, the dynamic CGE model of the Australian economy (Dixon and Rimmer 2002) that contains the dynamic mechanism features. The TRAVELTHAI model captures the structure of the Thai economy using the coefficients attributing from the Thai Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSAs) which is the main distinction from the other kinds of CGE models, for which normally use the Input Output Tables, the adoption of proper substitution elasticities as the key parameters, and the portrayal of specific features regarding tourism which are also relevant to the Thai economy. The model contains a detailed disaggregation of industries, especially those related to Tourism, factors of production, technologies and preferences, taxes and margins, a comprehensive illustration of government accounts, balance of payment accounts, and net foreign liabilities. The dynamic mechanisms also include the links between stock and flow variables for physical capital accumulation, for debt and savings, and for wage-employment adjustment. TRAVELTHAI possesses 3 types of tourism demands: Inbound, Domestic, and Outbound tourism. Although the thesis thematically focuses on inbound tourism or travel receipts in the Service accounts of the Balance of Payments, this gives the power to further study in terms of revenue and expenditure of the balance of travel. The baseline historical simulation of the Thai economy over the period 2001-2011 and baseline forecast for 2012-2020 are performed. The decade has shown an interesting rapid growth with the contribution of tourism growth of seven percent per annum on the average despite adverse tourism setbacks ranging from epidemic flu, tsunami, the recent political turmoil and the flood. Six major simulations with TRAVELTHAI have been conducted. The first is the historical simulation, for which observed changes in economic variables e.g. changes in GDP, outputs of industries, factors of production, household consumption or international trade become the exogenous shocks for the model, and changes in technologies and preferences are solved endogenously. This is aimed to develop the baseline for the Thai economy. Three projections to the year 2020 of the forecasting simulation have been carried out, bases on the evidence of the decade average, the first half and the second half of the previous decade. This time, the economic performance is evaluated from the structural changes in technologies and preferences obtained earlier and projects to the future to develop the baseline forecasts of these three projections. The fifth and the sixth are major simulations regarding the thesis objectives. They are those with external shocks and policy simulations. Simulation for external shocks of tourism setback in term of recent major flood is delivered. Behavioral effects of demand side and resource losses effect of supply side shocks are then applied in five sub-total shocks. Two behavioral effects are inbound tourism shift and the cut in the number of domestic tourists. Other three resources losses shocks are related to the losses or damages of factors of production: labor, capital, and land. The sixth simulation is the tourism-related fiscal policy on the tax cut for inbound tourism. The comparison between tax cut and without tax cut scenarios is also presented. This is aimed to pursue for alleviating measure to soothe the effect of tourism setback. Apart from historical and forecasting simulations which are aimed to create the benchmark as the baseline forecasts, the results from the setback simulation show that in the short run the flood causes the declines of real GDP and its compositions relative to the baseline. Trade balance deteriorates. Inbound tourism also decreases but not as much as outbound and domestic tourism. Domestic tourism revenue, thus, drops. Travel receipts accordingly weaken, but less than travel expenses worsen, which improves travel balance. For the supply side, the labors migrate to non-tourism industries from the tourism-related industries. Output productions are all reduced, with non-tourism industries most worsening. The flood damages the economy. In all, resource losses effects show domination over other effects. The after effect forecast growths to the year 2020 show that both behavioral and resource-loss effects of flooding reduce real GDP and its components overtime. Labors migrate to the non-tourism industries from direct tourism industries and tourism-connected industries. Direct tourism industries suffer more than tourism-connected industries in terms of labor reduction and the releases of labor rising through the period. All sectors produce less output, accordingly. Over-time slight deterioration in terms of trade subsequently improves balance of travel. Simulation on a tax cut as an incentive for the inbound tourist shows a plus to the falling real GDP relative to the baseline. Tax cut creates a larger impact on inbound tourism. Travel receipts increase accordingly, comparing to the decrease in the scenario without any tax cut. Tax cut improves balance of travel towards a surplus comparing to the lower gain of that without the tax cut. It also generates more outputs in the direct tourism industries as expected, though not enough to make a positive outcome for the total but the fall in the reduction of output production is a better off. This is in line with the greater amount of labor hired in the sector. For other two industries, they are worse off as their own labors migrate to the direct tourism industries. Their productions follow the falls in their sectoral employment. For the after effect tax cut forecast growth to 2020, only real inbound tourism and tourism receipts have considerable changes comparing to that without tax cut. For real inbound tourism, the after-flood growth is negative for without tax cut scenario in the short run and recover to be positive in the long run. With the tax cut, the deviation from base case forecast is positive and growing further in the long run. Tourism receipts show similar pattern. Nonetheless, the effect on the deviation over real GDP is very tiny and it reveals the same trend for both tax cut and without tax cut. Outputs and employments of direct tourism industries with tax cut decline less than that of without tax cut, though with similar declining trend. For tourism-connected industries, the reductions are about the same with the similar trend. For non-tourism industries, there are further output and employment reductions comparing to the without tax cut scenario. Tax cut incentive could be one of alleviating measures to soothe the tourism setback. Political-wise, a mix of incentives could be further pursued for what-if analyses to examine all inclusive effects other than tourism-focused.

FCFS consumption of supply occurs because it is accepted as a natural paradigm when the operators have no individual-specific information that allows consideration of any other serving order, and when users are assumed not to communicate among themselves. Thus, FCFS behaves as a status quo policy that is generally considered as fair, since it is presumed that all users are treated equally. We know though, that there exists heterogeneity in users' valuation of time and delay savings, and that the values may be different in different situations even for the same user. Taking advantage of smartphones and connected vehicle environments, it is now possible to include this user heterogeneity into operations in order to increase overall system efficiency and fairness, where efficiency refers to satisfaction of users. There are then possibilities of accomplishing this through exchanges among users with appropriate pricing, which can be determined by the users themselves to their satisfaction, so as to determine the order and extent of the utilization of supply. This new operational paradigm leads to collaborative consumption of supply.This dissertation explores the idea of violating FCFS by allowing users to trade in real-time the part of supply that they effectively “own” while they are in a transportation system. This de-facto ownership originates from the space-time region which each user rightfully controls, either due to their physical presence or due to reservations such as after purchasing a future trip from an operator. Attempting to answer the question of what pricing scheme would be fair and acceptable, leads this dissertation to introduce for the first time in transportation literature, the fundamental economic concept of envy-freeness. It can be taken as a pricing scheme as well as a user-behavior model. A resource allocation is said to be envy-free, when no agent feels any other agent's allocation to be better than their own, at the current price. An extension called dynamic envy-freeness is then developed for use in the domain of dynamic problems that the transportation field invariable pose, and a new family of envy-minimizing criteria are developed, namely the Constant Elasticity of Substitution Envy Intensity (CESEI) criteria, which strongly fits into the existing axiomatic body of Welfare Economics.Several applications of collaborative consumption that breaks FCFS ordering are explored in this dissertation. First, the dissertation develops PEXIC, Priced EXchanges in Intersection Control, in which users can pay other users to reduce their waiting delays in a fair manner. This system is shown to be Pareto-efficient, envy minimizing and financially self-sustainable. Second, it studies new operational policies in highway control: parallel queue routing policies for bottleneck situations where the vehicles' lane-queue selections are the results of trades, and queue-jumping operations for exit lanes where vehicles can take forward spots in a queue by paying the overtaken vehicles in a fair fashion that achieves queue stability. Third, it proposes Peer-to-peer (P2P) ride exchange in ridesharing systems, in which trip property rights are transferred to users in such a way that they can trade their rides between each other. Finally, the dissertation models a P2P ridesharing system as a dual role market exchange economy, introducing a truthful pricing scheme which includes High-Occupancy-Vehicle (HOV) lane savings and uses a novel min-cost max flow formulation that guarantees users a ride-back, a complementarity in preferences never explored before.The research does not attempt any elaborate examination of the social equity implications of such exchange-based systems with non-FCFS operations, but identifies some of such key issues and presents pointers for further study. It does not purport to take an advocacy position on transforming the transportation system operations to the newer paradigms, nor does it examine all the regulatory complications. The research does, however, demonstrate through modeling and analysis results from a variety of applications, that better system efficiency and user satisfaction can be achieved with the use of the proposed paradigms."

RubinOfirDavid2010Epie,,Equilibrium pricing in electricity markets with wind power,"Rubin, Ofir David",2010,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Estimates from the World Wind Energy Association assert that world total wind power installed capacity climbed from 18 Gigawatt (GW) to 152 GW from 2000 to 2009. Moreover, according to their predictions, by the end of 2010 global wind power capacity will reach 190 GW. Since electricity is a unique commodity, this remarkable expansion brings forward several key economic questions regarding the integration of significant amount of wind power capacity into deregulated electricity markets. The overall dissertation objective is to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that enables the modeling of the performance and outcome of wind-integrated electricity markets. This is relevant because the state of knowledge of modeling electricity markets is insufficient for the purpose of wind power considerations. First, there is a need to decide about a consistent representation of deregulated electricity markets. Surprisingly, the related body of literature does not agree on the very economic basics of modeling electricity markets. That is important since we need to capture the fundamentals of electricity markets before we introduce wind power to our study. For example, the structure of the electric industry is a key. If market power is present, the integration of wind power has large consequences on welfare distribution. Since wind power uncertainty changes the dynamics of information it also impacts the ability to manipulate market prices. This is because the quantity supplied by wind energy is not a decision variable. Second, the intermittent spatial nature of wind over a geographical region is important because the market value of wind power capacity is derived from its statistical properties. Once integrated into the market, the distribution of wind will impact the price of electricity produced from conventional sources of energy. Third, although wind power forecasting has improved in recent years, at the time of trading short-term electricity forwards, forecasting precision is still low. Therefore, it is crucial that the uncertainty in forecasting wind power is considered when modeling trading behavior. Our theoretical framework is based on finding a symmetric Cournot-Nash equilibrium in double-sided auctions in both forwards and spot electricity markets. The theoretical framework allows for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a model of electricity markets that explain two main empirical findings; the existence of forwards premium and spot market mark-ups. That is a significant contribution since so far forward premiums have been explained exclusively by the assumption of risk-averse behavior while spot mark-ups are the outcome of the body of literature assuming oligopolistic competition. In the next step, we extend the theoretical framework to account for deregulated electricity markets with wind power. Modeling a wind-integrated electricity market allows us to analyze market outcomes with respect to three main factors; the introduction of uncertainty from the supply side, ownership of wind power capacity and the geographical diversification of wind power capacity. For the purpose of modeling trade in electricity forwards one should simulate the information agents have regarding future availability of aggregate wind power. This is particularly important for modeling accurately traders’ ability to predict the spot price distribution. We develop a novel numerical methodology for the simulation of the conditional distribution of regional wind power at the time of trading short-term electricity forwards. Finally, we put the theoretical framework and the numerical methodology developed in this study to work by providing a detailed computational experiment examining electricity market outcomes for a particular expansion path of wind power capacity."

Therefore, social network theory and analyses is an ideal approach to understand industrial relations phenomena and outcomes. It is argued that network approaches are also able to address the challenge that industrial relations are becoming increasingly complex. Against this background in this chapter the reasons why network theories and analyses are ideal approaches to understand research phenomena in comparative industrial relations are explained. On that basis the chapter proposes the use of new methodologies that exploit the advantages of computational methods. More specifically it is argued and explained why simulation methods as agent-based models are promising tools for future theoretical and empirical research in the field of industrial relations."
HausnerUlrich2000Saap,,"Structural adjustment, agricultural performance and income distribution in Zambia: A computable general equilibrium analysis","Hausner, Ulrich",2000,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Since 1991 Zambia has embarked on an ambitious macroeconomic reform and structural adjustment program aimed at stabilizing the macroeconomic environment and shifting the economy from its dependence on copper exports to a broader-based economic growth. Since Zambia has ample arable land and rainfall, it is comparatively well suited for agricultural production. This study examines the effects of policy changes on the Zambian economy, particularly on agricultural resource allocation and the economic welfare of various groups. It summarizes reforms and structural adjustments that have been implemented, constructs an agriculture-focused social accounting matrix (SAM) for Zambia in 1995, and applies the methodology of computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling to simulate the effects of reforms. The data for the 1995 SAM for Zambia are drawn from various official Zambian and other sources including input-output tables, national accounts, government budgets, trade statistics and household surveys. Agricultural input technologies and input flows are derived from farm budgets and estimates of small-scale, medium-scale and commercial production in 1994/95. A cross entropy approach to estimating a consistent SAM is used to balance the initially scattered and inconsistent data set. The CGE model is of a neoclassical structuralist type. It is formulated as an open-economy, single country, static model. It reflects the optimizing behavior of microeconomic agents and emphasizes inter-sectoral linkages in production, consumption, and trade. Income flows within the economy are specifically recorded. The model is calibrated to the Zambian SAM in 1995. Policy experiments are designed to simulate the effects of trade liberalization and exchange rate devaluation, and to investigate continued dependence on copper production. Empirical results show that Zambia's tariff and tax system favored agriculture more than industries and services by placing a higher tax burden on non-agricultural sectors. Sectors which benefit the most from a real devaluation are agricultural non-food crops, like cotton, tobacco, and coffee, and non-factor services. Results from devaluation experiments also confirm the expected high import dependency of non-agricultural export production. When exposed to declining mining productivity, the magnitude of counterbalancing real devaluations is highly dependent on the degree of factor mobility, constraining domestic supply responses."
SalviniGiulia2016RaCS,,REDD+ and Climate Smart Agriculture in Landscapes : From National Design to Local Implementation,"Salvini, Giulia",2016,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Global challenges posed by increasing food demand and climate change (CC) call for innovative and integrated mechanisms that include both agriculture and forests. Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) are the main approaches dealing with these challenges and are currently high on the development agendas. CSA represents in principle a technical solution to food security and adaptation. REDD+ is a global mechanism that is particularly valuable in addressing CC mitigation. CSA and REDD+ are connected through the inherent relationship between forests and agriculture. Despite this, REDD+ and CSA are rather disconnected in reality and there is a growing call for REDD+ interventions to lower deforestation via improved agriculture. The merging of the two can be achieved via a Climate Smart Landscape (CSL) approach, an integrated landscape-level approach that allows to analyse the landscape dynamics leading to deforestation and to assess the trades-off between land uses. The CSL approach emphasizes stakeholder involvement and simultaneous achievement of multiple objectives including food security, rural livelihoods, CC mitigation and adaptation.The transition to CSL relies upon coherent policies that acknowledge the linkages between forests and agriculture. Moreover CSL requires active involvement of stakeholders in different layers of governance, including policy makers, NGOs, agribusiness companies, local farmers and researchers. Hence such a transition is based upon an understanding of local stakeholders’ decision-making, social learning and collective action. The main objective of this thesis was to assess REDD+ and CSA implementation in landscapes and to introduce a framework to enable CSL realization. We performed this assessment via different levels of analysis, from policy assessment to local implementation, structured in four chapters.Chapter 2 provides an assessment of national REDD+ policies aimed at addressing drivers of deforestation and forest degradation (DD). Via this assessment we show that drivers of DD originate not only from inside but also from outside the forest sector (i.e.: agriculture, infrastructure development, mining, etc.). Such results contributed to a deeper understanding of how national REDD+ policies can be (re)designed to better address such drivers. Additionally, we draw considerations about the implications on monitoring systems and on the importance to monitor not only forest cover but also activities outside the forest sector. Such monitoring would provide increasingly detailed information about drivers of DD, allowing the (re)design of more effective REDD+ policy interventionsChapter 3 introduces a framework for an ex-ante assessment of land management policies and interventions and for quantifying their impacts on land-based mitigation and adaptation goals. The framework is centred on local stakeholders involvement in a continuous process of policy (re)design, to make them more tailor made to the specific local context. It includes a companion modelling (ComMod) process informed by interviews with policymakers, local experts and local farmers. The ComMod process consists of a role-playing game with local farmers and an agent-based model. The game provided a participatory means to develop policy and climate change scenarios. These scenarios were then used as inputs to the agent-based model, a spatially explicit model to simulate landscape dynamics and the associated carbon emissions over decades. We applied the framework using as case study a community in central Vietnam, characterized by deforestation for subsistence agriculture and cultivation of Acacias as a cash crop.Chapter 4 provides a first review of projects initiated by agribusiness companies via a Landscape Approach (LA) and their contribution to achieve Climate Smart Landscapes (CSL). Agribusiness companies play an important role in shaping the implementation of the LA, as they often have resources such as physical, financial, human and social capital. Hence they may influence the sustainability of the landscape where they operate by linking with local stakeholders. Our research investigates what drives agribusiness in initiating landscape scale projects and it provides a review of their project activities and their contributions to achieve CSL goals."

Departament d'Economia i d'Història Econòmica",2016,,,,,,,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Barcelona,"Es conocido que las expectativas juegan un papel importante en las decisiones de los agentes y son una característica fundamental en macroeconomía. Típicamente, en los modelos utilizados en macroeconomía es asumido que los agentes tienen expectativas racionales. Esto signi ca que los agentes en el modelo conocen perfectamente las funciones de equilibrio y se comportan óptimamente. Este supuesto simpli ca las alternativas del modelo, ya que evita tener que hacer supuestos diferentes sobre las expectativas. Tambi én, evita la Crítica de Lucas puesto que los agentes incorporan en sus expectativas los cambios en política. Sin embargo, algunas veces este supuesto tiene consecuencias que no se cumplen en los datos. En estos casos, un desvío es asumir que el agente únicamente conoce la forma de los procesos de equilibrio y se comporta óptimamente. Este supuesto es llamado expectativas adaptativas de aprendizaje. Esta tesis examina escenarios donde las hipótesis de expectativas racionales fala al reproducir el comportamiento de las variables en los datos y usa la hipótesis de expectativas adaptativas para encontrar respuestas. El primer capítulo, titulado Money, In ation, and In ation Expectations, documenta una relación signi cativamente negativa entre dinero y expectativas de in ación en el periodo 1990-2007 en EE.UU. nueva en la literatura. Al mismo tiempo, documenta una relación no signi cativa entre dinero e in ación, consistente con la literatura. De no la In ation Expectations and Money Puzzle como la di cultad de un modelo con expectativas racionales para reproducir ambos hechos. Un modelo de Dinero en la Función de Utilidad con un shock en la demanda de dinero y dotaciones exógenas genera ambos hechos cuando el agente aprende sobre el proceso de in ación. Si el dinero se ajusta endógenamente para mantener la in ación cercana a un objetivo, el dinero varía mientras la in ación es estable. Puesto que los agentes no saben el proceso de la in ación, las expectativas de in ación pueden responder positivamente a shock pasados mientras el dinero decrece para compensar los efectos de las expectativas en la in ación. Esto explica la IEMP. El segundo capítulo, titulado Long-Run Behavior from an Endogenous Monetary Pol- icy Perspective, se centra en la relación de largo plazo entre in ación, tipo de interés nominal y dinero en EE.UU. Mientras que en el periodo anterior a la desin ación de Volcker las variables tuvieron una relación de uno-a-uno, durante los últimos veinte años no hubo una relación signi cativa. Aquí se documentan estas relaciones centrándose en un periodo muestral largo, 1960-2007, y otro corto, 1990-2007, y cuestiona si una política monetaria endógena como la del capítulo anterior podría reproducir el comportamiento de largo-plazo de estas variables. Concluyo que ni la versión de expectativas racionales ni el de expectativas adaptativas es capaz de generar ambos comportamientos y subrayo la importancia de alguna característica no incluida en el modelo. El tercer capítulo, titulado Asset Pricing in an Heterogeneous Expectations Model, introduce un modelo basado en consumo de valoración de activos con agentes que usen expectativas racionales y expectativas adaptativas. Evalúa el desempeño de este modelo estimando los parámetros usando datos de precios de activos en EE.UU. a través de la técnica del método de simulación de momentos. El modelo sugiere que, por un lado, la persistencia de los retornos de activos y, por otro lado, la volatilidad de los retornos de activos y del ratio precio-dividendo se contraponen y la proporción de agentes que aprenden juega un papel central. This thesis is focused on the role of expectations in the economy. It is well-known that expectations play a prominent role in decision making and are a crucial feature in macroe- conomics. Typically, in macroeconomic modeling it is assumed that agents are endowed with rational expectations. This basically means that agents in the model perfectly know the general equilibrium functions of the model and behave optimally. Many times this assumption is appropriate because it simpli es modeling choices, as it avoids having to make separate assumptions about agents' expectations. Also, rational expectations avoids Lucas' Critique as agents in the model incorporate policy changes into their expectations. However, it sometimes attaches features that the data does not reproduce. In those cases, it is worthy to slightly deviate from rational expectations and assume agents does not perfectly know equilibrium functions (but know the form of the function) and still behave optimally. This is what is called adaptive learning expectations. This thesis examines some scenarios where the rational expectations hypothesis fails to reproduce the behavior of the variables in the data and looks for answers using the adaptive learning expectations hypothesis instead. The rst chapter, entitled Money, In ation, and In ation Expectations, documents a signi cant negative relation between money and in ation expectations for the 1990-2007 period in the US which is new to the literature. During the same period, there existed a weak relation between money growth and in ation consistent with the literature. I call In ation Expectations and Money Puzzle (IEMP) to the di culty of a rational expec- tations model to reproduce both facts. A simple Money-in-the-Utility (MIU) function model with a money demand shock and exogenous endowment accounts for both facts when the representative agent learns about the true in ation process. If money supply adjusts endogenously to keep in ation rate close to a target and smooth, money varies whereas in ation keeps stable. Because the agent does not know the true in ation pro- cess, in ation expectations might respond positively to past shocks whereas money supply decreases to o set their potential e ects on in ation. This disentangles the IEMP. The second chapter, entitled Long-Run Behavior from an Endogenous Monetary Policy Perspective, looks to the long-run relation between in ation, nominal interest rate, and money growth. Recently, it has been noted the long-run relation between these variables have changed. Whereas in the period before the Volcker disin ation they had a one-to- one relation, during the last two decades there were no signi cant relation. This study documents the long-run relation of those variables focusing on a long sample, 1960-2007, and a short-sample, 1990-2007, and questions whether the endogenous monetary policy model of the previous chapter could match the change in the long-run relation of this variables. It concludes neither a rational expectations nor a learning expectations version of the model is able to replicate this behavior and highlights the importance of some feature that is not attached to the model. The third chapter, entitled Asset Pricing in an Heterogeneous Expectations Model, studies how can be introduced a consumption-based asset pricing model with rational agents and agents that learn about the market outcomes. It evaluates the performance of this model estimating the relevant parameters using the U.S. asset pricing data through the method of simulated moments technique. The model suggests that, in the one hand, persistence of stock returns and, in the other hand, volatility of stock returns and price dividends ratio provide a trade-o in which the proportion of learners plays a key role."

Policy-level specifications define constraints and guidelines under which an enterprise operates, and they are an extension to the REA enterprise model, adding the “what should, could, or must be” to the “what is.” This paper aims both at comprehensive understanding of policy-level definitions as part of REA enterprise systems and at understanding of the semantic constructs that enable such definitions. We first explore two distinctive semantic abstractions essential to policy-level specifications: typification and grouping. The typification abstraction links instances of an object class to concepts for which they are concrete realizations, while the grouping abstraction aggregates objects into collections. We next present a number of patterns for the semantic modeling of policies. Following, we look at policy-level applications for REA enterprise information systems. We explore type and grouping definitions for the REA primitives (resource, event, agent) and discuss enterprise applications for three different kinds of policy definitions: knowledge-intensive descriptions, validation rules, and target descriptions. Our discussion of specific enterprise applications includes internal control applications (e.g., limit checks), variance analysis based on standard specifi-cations (e.g., bills of materials), and budgeting applications."
SmithCraigM2010Sofi,,Simulation of factors impeding water quality trading market performance,"Smith, Craig M and Peterson, Jeffrey M and Leatherman, John C",2010,,,,,,,,,"Over the past several decades, market-based approaches to natural resource management have received increased attention as a means to cost-effectively achieve environmental quality goals. Following on what has been hailed a success for reducing air pollution, water quality trading (WQT) has more recently been seen as the next great opportunity for reducing water pollution, especially for nutrient loading. Numerous trading programs have been pilot tested and/or adopted in states throughout the nation, with more than 70 programs now in operation (Breetz et al., 2004). WQT would allow multiple contributors to surface water degradation to determine how best to meet an overarching collective goal related to pollution reduction. WQT takes advantage of differences in pollution abatement costs. In the case of point/nonpoint source trading, such as between wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and agricultural producers, it is often the agricultural producers who can achieve a given level of nutrient reduction at less cost through their adoption of various best management practices that reduce sedimentation and nutrient loading to surface waters. Trading would allow WWTPs to purchase “credits” generated by producers who reduced their pollution loading to achieve an equivalent level of reduction as might be required by a regulatory discharge permit at a lower overall cost. While there is substantial evidence that nonpoint sources have lower nutrient reduction costs than point sources, experience with WQT reveals a common theme: little or no trading activity. The success of WQT seems, in part, to depend on the structure of the market created to bring buyers and sellers together to transact exchanges. These outcomes suggest the presence of obstacles to trading that were not recognized in the design of existing programs. To examine the ways that various market imperfections may impact the performance of a WQT market, an agent-based model was constructed which simulated a hypothetical point-nonpoint market. In particular, the market was modeled using a variant of the sequential, bilateral trading algorithm proposed by Atkinson and Tietenberg (1991). Our proposed paper first presents an overview of the simulation modeling technique and then analyzes the effects of two prominent market impediments identified in the WQT literature: information levels and trading ratios. Information levels refer to buyers’ and sellers’ knowledge of each others’ bid prices. A frictionless WQT market would be one where all of the potential buyers (i.e., point sources) would know all of the sellers’ (i.e., nonpoint sources) offer prices and vice versa. In this full information environment, we can expect that trades would be consummated in the order of their gains. That is, first buyers and sellers to be paired together for trading would be the buyers with the highest offer prices and the sellers with the lowest bid prices. Successive trades will have successively smaller gains until the gap between bid and offer prices reaches zero. This is the textbook Walrasian market and would closely approximate a double auction institution, where all buyers and sellers submit their offers and bids, which are then sorted and matched by a centralized market manager. While the full information scenario serves as a useful benchmark, most existing WQT markets are decentralized in nature, so that limited information causes traders to be matched in a less efficient sequence. A variety of information levels are possible. One side of the market may have more information than the other (limited information) or neither side having any knowledge of the other side’s bid or offer prices (low information). Each of these scenarios leads to a different sequencing of trades. This paper analyzes the effect of different information levels on market performance. Market performance is measured in terms of cost savings, the number of credits traded, and the average reduction costs under different information scenarios. Trading ratios are a common component of many existing WQT programs. A typical trading ratio of 2:1 requires a nonpoint source to reduce two pounds of expected nutrient loading in order to receive one pound of trading credit. These ratios serve as a “safety factor” and are incorporated to account for the uncertainty in the measurement and monitoring of nonpoint source loading. Because nonpoint traders must reduce loading by 2 pounds for every 1 pound emitted by point source traders, there will be a net reduction of 1 pound of expected loading for each trade. So, while inhibiting some trades from ever occurring, trading ratios also have the potential to improve water quality beyond trading with a 1:1 trading ratio. This paper examines these tradeoffs in terms of effects on market performance and then describes procedures that can be used to characterize an optimal trading ratio if one exists. Because WQT programs, by nature, involve complex interactions between economics and the biophysical world, accurately simulating a real-world WQT market requires at minimum a basic understanding of the types of data that watershed models can provide. This paper concludes by briefly discussing data requirements, points of consideration, and integrative techniques used in the simulation of WQT in real-world watersheds."

JiangNa2022EUSv,,Exploring Urban Shrinkage via Computational Approaches: A Case Study of the City of Detroit,"Jiang, Na",2022,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"While the world’s total urban population continues to grow, not all cities are witnessing such growth, some are actually shrinking. This shrinkage causes several problems to emerge including population loss, economic depression, vacant properties and the contraction of housing markets. Such problems challenge efforts to make cities sustainable. While there is a growing body of work on study shrinking cities, few explore such a phenomenon through computational approaches. To further explore on this phenomenon, this work mainly focuses on three main questions: RQ1:How does urban shrinkage emerge at the macro-level through the simulation of housing trades at the individual level? RQ2: How can patterns of shrinkage be measured through a simulation? RQ3: To what extent can urban shrinkage be revealed by the analysis of newspaper articles? This work uses Detroit Tri-County Area as a study area to explore these three research questions. Two agent-based models (ABM) are built to simulate the housing trades within the Detroit Tri-County Area and the two models' results capture the city of Detroit's shrinkage from the aspect of decreasing numbers of households at the macro-level, which can be considered as the population loss. In addition, a pattern with a collapsing downtown housing market can be measured by visualizing the simulation results. By utilizing natural language processing (i.e., topic modeling) on a large number of newspapers related to Detroit, insights related to Detroit's shrinkage can be linked to the side effects of the economy recession on Detroit's automobile industry, local employment status, and housing market. The two agent-based models built in this work significantly add to the nascent field of inquiry by specifically capturing how the buying and selling of houses can lead to urban shrinkage from the bottom-up, which contributes to the computational social science (CSS) field of social simulation modeling. The topic modeling extends the field of text-contents analysis by identifying the insights related to urban shrinkage phenomenon from a large number of newspapers, which adds to the field of social information extraction under the CSS domain."

V.",2012,,,,225-232,,,IEEE,,"This work aims at providing an energy-efficient perspective to the problem of contention-based synchronization in (orthogonal) frequency-division multiple-access communication systems. This is achieved by modeling the terminals and their corresponding receivers at the base station as economic and rational agents that engage in a noncooperative game, in which each one trades off its available resources so as to selfishly maximize its own revenue (in terms of probability of code detection) while saving as much energy as possible. Quality-of-service requirements given in terms of probability of false alarm and timing estimation accuracy are added to the problem formulation. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium of the game are studied. An iterative and distributed algorithm based on best-response dynamics (at the transmit side) and a practical parameter estimation (at the receive side) are proposed to achieve the equilibrium point. Numerical results are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution in terms of power consumption, average synchronization time and estimation accuracy and to make comparisons with existing alternatives."

Since electricity is a unique commodity, this remarkable expansion brings forward several key economic questions regarding the integration of significant amount of wind power capacity into deregulated electricity markets. The overall dissertation objective is to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that enables the modeling of the performance and outcome of wind-integrated electricity markets.

Once integrated into the market, the distribution of wind will impact the price of electricity produced from conventional sources of energy. Third, although wind power forecasting has improved in recent years, at the time of trading short-term electricity forwards, forecasting precision is still low. Therefore, it is crucial that the uncertainty in forecasting wind power is considered when modeling trading behavior. Our theoretical framework is based on finding a symmetric Cournot-Nash equilibrium in double-sided auctions in both forwards and spot electricity markets. The theoretical framework allows for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a model of electricity markets that explain two main empirical findings; the existence of forwards premium and spot market mark-ups. That is a significant contribution since so far forward premiums have been explained exclusively by the assumption of risk-averse behavior while spot mark-ups are the outcome of the body of literature assuming oligopolistic competition. In the next step, we extend the theoretical framework to account for deregulated electricity markets with wind power. Modeling a wind-integrated electricity market allows us to analyze market outcomes with respect to three main factors; the introduction of uncertainty from the supply side, ownership of wind power capacity and the geographical diversification of wind power capacity. For the purpose of modeling trade in electricity forwards one should simulate the information agents have regarding future availability of aggregate wind power. This is particularly important for modeling accurately traders' ability to predict the spot price distribution. We develop a novel numerical methodology for the simulation of the conditional distribution of regional wind power at the time of trading short-term electricity forwards. Finally, we put the theoretical framework and the numerical methodology developed in this study to work by providing a detailed computational experiment examining electricity market outcomes for a particular expansion path of wind power capacity."

Isabel's wind speed had slowed to around 100 mph before reaching the coastline, making it a borderline Category 1-to-Category 2 storm. Initial pre-landfall estimates by catastrophe and weather risk modeling firms ranged from $500 million to $2 billion in insured loss. Newark, Calif.-based Risk Management Solutions, for instance, said last week the insured loss from Isabel could fall in the $500 million-to-$2 billion range, depending on the hurricane's eventual intensity and track, while AIR Worldwide, a subsidiary of Insurance Services Office in Jersey City, N.J., forecast the p-c industry's insured loss would be in the $l-to-$2 billion range."

However, with limited opportunities for new highway and transit infrastructure in congested areas, ""demand-oriented"" policy measures (travel demand management), which allow for more efficient use of existing road and transit capacity, require improved methods of analysis. This feature presents a new operational prototype microsimulation model of travel and activity scheduling for household agents (TASHA), which provides more precise : model outputs than current state-of-practice models with little increase in supporting data requirements. It is argued that the model significantly improves the ability to analyze demand-oriented policy measures. Several example transportation policy problems in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, demonstrate the potential benefits of the TASHA modeling approach over current methods. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

cdi_crossref_primary_10_1287_opre_1120_1145,,In This Issue,,2012,Operations research,60,6,iii-vi,,,,,"Chapter 13 of the Old Testament's Book of Numbers begins, “And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: ‘Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan.’” Although intelligence operations have become more sophisticated since Moses' time, the basic steps remain the same: collect information and analyze it with the goal of providing reasoned assessments that reduce uncertainty and help political or military leaders make better decisions. The topic of intelligence is potentially of special interest to operations researchers for two reasons. First, intelligence is a product resulting from several distinct operations, and as with all products, there are better and worse ways to produce it, which leads to a natural focus on research. Second, there are several opportunities for the application of tools from the broad sweep of operations research methods to specific intelligence questions; this set of problems can be construed as intelligence operations research. “Intelligence Operations Research” is the archival record of Kaplan's Philip McCord Morse Lecture on this topic. Consumer tax preparation applications comprise a profitable niche in software development. Internal Revenue Service efforts to achieve an 80% electronic filing rate for major returns by 2013 has bolstered the growth in tax preparation software. Companies producing tax preparation software must process thousands of state and federal tax forms and release their product on time to protect their market share. “A Hierarchical Framework for Organizing a Software Development Process,” by F. Iravani, S. Dasu, and R. Ahmadi proposes hierarchical optimization models for organizing a complex tax software development process at a leading U.S. software company. The models assign tax forms to groups to control the process more effectively and staff the groups such that they complete processing the assigned tax forms by the release deadline. Implementing the hierarchical models helped the company reduce overtime hours by 31%, reduce total workforce cost by 13%, and release the tax software on time. When a new, more critical patient arrives in a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) and no bed is available, physicians must discharge a current patient. The discharged patient may require readmission to the ICU, thus straining the already congested resources. Currently, no objective (severity-based using strict physiologic criteria) standards for ICU admission and discharge exist. In “Optimizing Intensive Care Unit Discharge Decisions with Patient Readmissions,” C. W. Chan, V. F. Farias, N. Bambos, and G. J. Escobar provide a systematic and evidence-based discharge strategy for ICU patients when incoming demand necessitates the discharge of a current patient. This work establishes a methodological framework to examine the performance of an index policy that accounts for patient readmissions when making ICU discharge decisions. The major implication of this work is that, in the future, discharge strategies could be linked to objective physiologic criteria to improve patient outcomes and increase efficiency. Flooding can cause significant loss of life and economic damage. The 1953 floods in the southwestern parts of the Netherlands demonstrated the flooding risks to that country. Soon after 1953, Van Dantzig started the cost-benefit analysis of the dike height optimization problem, which looks for the optimal balance between investing in dikes (costs) and reducing flood risk (benefits). In “Safe Dike Heights at Minimal Costs: The Nonhomogeneous Case,” R. Brekelmans, D. den Hertog, K. Roos, and C. Eijgenraam extend Van Dantzig's model and address the fundamental questions of when and how much to invest where. The authors formulate this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model and combine state-of-the-art solvers with techniques that exploit the problem structure. Dutch government agencies use the model to analyze the main dike rings in the Netherlands and to propose new safety standards to incorporate into the Dutch Water Act. Probabilistically constrained optimization problems with discretely distributed random variables are computationally challenging. In “Pattern-Based Modeling and Solution of Probabilistically Constrained Optimization Problems,” M. Lejeune develops a combinatorial pattern-based framework to model such problems. The method scales remarkably well and solves exactly and very fast stochastic problems where uncertainty is represented by an extremely large (up to 50,000) number of scenarios. This is a key and distinctive feature of the method. It permits reformulating the stochastic problems as mixed-integer ones in which the number of binary variables is not an increasing function of the number of scenarios used to characterize the uncertainty. In the current financial crisis, central banks worldwide have saved major banks from going into default. Companies and banks are closely linked in today's global economy, and negative events such as a major bank's bankruptcy will immediately harm the economy as a whole. In “Computing Optimal Recovery Policies for Financial Markets,” F. Benth, G. Dahl, and C. Mannino pose the question of how the central bank should optimally recover the economy rescuing one or more financial institutions. The agents in the market all have a risk for default, which we model as a Markov random field. The probabilistic model accounts for default correlation among agents as well as credit ratings. Combinatorial methods support the efficient solution of the central bank's recovery problem. In fact, because the results indicate that it is practically feasible with economies having up to 100 agents, realistic modeling is within reach. Developed at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, the Black-Litterman model uses a Bayesian-style analysis to blend market information with an investor's private views to create customized estimates of future asset returns. This approach suffers some drawbacks, such as its basis in the stylized mean-variance paradigm of portfolio allocation and the limited types of investor views it supports. Most prior work has sought to address these drawbacks by extending the underlying probabilistic framework. In “Inverse Optimization: A New Perspective on the Black-Litterman Model,” D. Bertsimas, V. Gupta, and I. Ch. Paschalidis replace the original model's statistical framework with ideas from inverse optimization. Unlike the original model, this formulation can incorporate general risk measures and leverage investor views on volatility and market dynamics. Backtesting against historical data suggests these “inverse optimization” based portfolios often demonstrate a better risk-reward trade-off than their Black-Litterman counterparts and are more robust to incorrect investor views. Zara, a leading fast-fashion retailer, holds a clearance period for several weeks after each of its two annual selling seasons. This is a challenging problem because they have more articles (SKUs) than traditional retailers, with each individual article initially available in smaller quantities, and there is less historical price response data at the beginning of the clearance period due to a lack of promotions during the regular season. In 2008, Zara started using an operations research-based model to optimize its markdown decisions. F. Caro and J. Gallien describe the model and its implementation in “Clearance Pricing Optimization for a Fast-Fashion Retailer.” The project not only provided a uniform set of metrics and criteria for markdown pricing but also gave Zara's employees access to computational power and decision-making frameworks and generated better operational decisions, leading to a 6% increase in revenues as verified by a live pilot. Choosing the appropriate flexible technology is a classic management problem. An important documented research insight is that “a little flexibility goes a long way” when used in a chained configuration. In “A Little Flexibility Is All You Need: On the Asymptotic Value of Flexible Capacity in Parallel Queuing Systems, “ A. Bassamboo, R. S. Randhawa, and J. A. Van Mieghem show that in high-volume symmetric queuing systems with N customer types, the asymptotically optimal configuration of the flexible resource portfolio follows two principles: tailoring, the use of dedicated resources to provide base capacity to serve most of the demand, with a small amount of level-2 flexibility serving the variable demand; and pairing, where each product is “paired” with every other product via a level-2 flexible resource. With three product types, pairing is identical to chaining. A numerical study suggests that the authors' analytic results extend to systems with low volumes and asymmetric demands or flexibility configurations. Most powerful firms of the 21st century are vertically disintegrated—they focus on their internal core competencies and outsource other operations to specialized third parties. The ability to outsource is even more crucial for small and mid-size enterprises, allowing them to compete with their larger competitors. However, outsourcing can lead to great loss if not managed properly. In “Coordination of Outsourced Operations at a Third-Party Facility Subject to Booking, Overtime, and Tardiness Costs,” X. Cai and G. L. Vairaktarakis show that the typical first-come-first-book protocol for third-party capacity, a common industrial policy, is wasteful. They develop algorithms that allow manufacturers to optimally book third-party capacity. Using cooperative game theory, they propose a model for the third party to optimize and coordinate the outsourced operations, which lets everyone benefit from the system's savings. They also propose a mechanism that enforces truth-telling among parties to prevent any self-interested party from manipulating the savings allocation scheme. The valuation of investment opportunities using normative decision theory requires the risk attitud"
CosciaCarlFrancis2005Teog,,Three essays on government formation,"Coscia, Carl Francis",2005,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The formation of ruling parliamentary coalitions involves balancing the policy goals of different parties, the need for coalition cohesion, and the desire of individual parties to maximize their share of government spoils. To improve the modeling of government formations, I introduce policy into a stochastic bargaining game with transferable utility and complete information. Policy affects the utility function of the political agents, the probability that any given party is selected to lead the government coalition bargaining process, and the distribution of benefits over which the political agents are bargaining. Introducing policy in these three key areas allows me to model how political agents trade off policy concerns and coalition cohesiveness with the desire for long lived governments, a greater share of the benefits from holding office, and a desire for shorter negotiation durations. Additionally, this introduction of policy provides a key variable that differentiates parties in terms of estimating the model of government formation. I structurally estimate the bargaining model using maximum likelihood techniques and a data set detailing the government formation process for six Western European countries from 1945-1998. The results of this estimation are a significant improvement over the existing literature in terms of fitting the data on-proposer selection, negotiation duration, government duration, and government coalition membership. First, the introduction of policy into the proposer selection mechanism offers a significant improvement in fit over other models based on proportional selection. Second, the estimates of the policy parameters in the utility function provide insights into how policy and benefits are traded among the political agents. The estimated policy parameters in the utility function imply that political agents are willing to make larger compromises in policy for smaller gains in political spoils. Lastly; by introducing policy into the stochastic process of government benefits, the estimated parameters indicate that government coalitions with greater policy dispersion will experience significantly lower government duration. This is a significant improvement in the literature because it explains why large radical parties are often excluded from governments despite their prominence in terms of seat shares within a parliament."

SmithCraigMatthew2011Aaoa,,"An analysis of alternative soil, nutrient, and water management strategies","Smith, Craig Matthew",2011,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The two topics addressed in this dissertation are both related to surface water quality. Reservoir sedimentation and water quality trading are examined from economic and environmental perspectives. Each topic and the resulting policy implications are relevant to stakeholders at the local, state, and federal levels. Reservoir Sedimentation. Reservoir sedimentation has been recognized as a major environmental, social, and economic issue in much of the Midwestern US. There is an effort to focus public and private funds to achieve the greatest return on the investment from soil erosion and sediment reduction strategies. How can physiographical and economic relationships within the watershed be quantified in such a way to provide insights into the selection of alternative management strategies? This study focuses on answering that question by integrating a physically-based watershed model with an economic analysis of alternative sedimentation reduction strategies for the case of Tuttle Creek Lake located in northeastern Kansas. Several key finding of this study are that both physiographical and economic factors must be considered for cost-effective conservation to occur. Considering these factors and targeting BMP implementation from 8 to 23 times more cost-effective than random implementation. If targeting cannot be done effectively or if “intangible” costs of BMP implementation are too large, dredging is likely to be more cost-effective. While this research compares the cost-effectiveness of various BMP implementation approaches in Kansas with dredging, the benefits associated with each of these strategies is not addressed. Water Quality Trading. While there is substantial evidence that nonpoint sources have lower nutrient reduction costs than point sources, experience with water quality trading (WQT) reveals a common theme: little or no trading activity. These outcomes suggest the presence of obstacles to trading that were not recognized in the design of existing programs. To examine the ways that various market imperfections may impact the performance of a WQT market, an agent-based model is constructed, which simulates a hypothetical point-nonpoint market. This study first presents an overview of the concepts and simulation modeling technique used and then analyzes the effects of two prominent market impediments identified in the WQT literature: information levels and trading ratios. The results imply that if market designers feel that only a limited number of trades will be consummated, creating an institution that provides accessible information about buyers’ prices is preferred to providing information about sellers’ prices. Overall, more information is always better, but it becomes less important with higher trading ratios."
ChakravartySurajeet2002Eoci,,Essays on contracting in the construction industry,"Chakravarty, Surajeet",2002,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Writing contracts is expensive. Due to this cost, agents often leave contracts incomplete. The cost of writing contracts increase as complexity of the transactions increase. Complexity and cost of contracting affects the type of contracts and also the contractual relationship. Incompleteness in the contract also leads to inefficiencies in the trade and increases the role of law. In the first essay, I discuss and analyze contractual relationship in the construction industry. I look at the legal rules that are prevalent in the industry and show that the most legal rules used are efficiency based. I discuss contract formation, liquidated damages, material breach, and remedies and find that all these doctrines used are such that the total trade surplus is maximized. Though most doctrines are based on the economic efficiency principle there are a few rules that are based on fairness. In the second essay, I study risk and uncertainty in contracts. Contractual relationships are often fraught with uncertainties. And how do modeling uncertainty rather than risk change results? This question is answered by analyzing three different contracting situations. While in case of contracts for bilateral trade there is no difference between risk and uncertainty, if the contracts are written for joint ownership then having uncertain agents may result in no renegotiation but with risk averse agents there always renegotiation. Lastly a possibility of no trade is shown if agents are uncertain. In the last essay, I analyze how complexity affects contracting. Complexity is an important issue in contracting and this is evident in the construction industry. Large number of contracts ends up in disputes and as a result the damages imposed by the courts play an important role in the effort made by the agents. The optimal damage rule is characterized. Expectation damage is optimal, but if the contractor has all the bargaining power reliance damages does better."
GershkovAlex2014AtAR,,About the Arne Ryde Foundation,"Gershkov, Alex and Moldovanu, Benny",2014,,,,ix-,,,The MIT Press,United States,"A new approach to dynamic allocation and pricing that blends dynamic paradigms from the operations research and management science literature with classical mechanism design methods. Dynamic allocation and pricing problems occur in numerous frameworks, including the pricing of seasonal goods in retail, the allocation of a fixed inventory in a given period of time, and the assignment of personnel to incoming tasks. Although most of these problems deal with issues treated in the mechanism design literature, the modern revenue management (RM) literature focuses instead on analyzing properties of restricted classes of allocation and pricing schemes. In this book, Alex Gershkov and Benny Moldovanu propose an approach to optimal allocations and prices based on the theory of mechanism design, adapted to dynamic settings. Drawing on their own recent work on the topic, the authors describe a modern theory of RM that blends the elegant dynamic models from the operations research (OR), management science, and computer science literatures with techniques from the classical mechanism design literature. Illustrating this blending of approaches, they start with well-known complete information, nonstrategic dynamic models that yield elegant explicit solutions. They then add strategic agents that are privately informed and then examine the consequences of these changes on the optimization problem of the designer. Their sequential modeling of both nonstrategic and strategic logic allows a clear picture of the delicate interplay between dynamic trade-offs and strategic incentives. Topics include the sequential assignment of heterogeneous objects, dynamic revenue optimization with heterogeneous objects, revenue maximization in the stochastic and dynamic knapsack model, the interaction between learning about demand and dynamic efficiency, and dynamic models with long-lived, strategic agents."

cdi_crossref_primary_10_1287_opre_1120_1100,,In This Issue,,2012,Operations research,60,4,iii-vi,,,,,"In the financial industry, sell-side analysts periodically publish recommendations of underlying securities with target prices. Those recommendations reflect specific economic conditions and influence investors' decisions and thus price movements. However, they do not provide risk measures associated with underlying companies. Risk measures are not just for financial services but for every industry. For example, headlines of the past year have highlighted volatile oil prices impacting industries around the world. The impact of rising oil prices on total supply chain cost is substantial, and we cannot make the right strategic decisions without understanding the risk associated with oil price movements. In “Conditional Value-at-Risk and Average Value-at-Risk: Estimation and Asymptotics,” S. Y. Chun, A. Shapiro, and S. Uryasev study various ways to estimate risk measures for a single asset at given market conditions. This information could be useful for investors and managers when comparing prospective alternatives. Given the scarcity of donated organs, end-stage liver disease patients who need a liver transplant currently face a prolonged wait. In “A Broader View of Designing the Liver Allocation System,” M. Akan, O. Alagoz, B. Ata, F. S. Erenay, and A. Said study the allocation of livers to waiting list patients with an eye on the trade-off between medical urgency and efficiency. To capture both criteria, the authors optimize a weighted combination of the total deaths of waiting list patients and the total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). At one extreme, the current sickest-first policy of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) emerges as the optimal policy to minimize deaths. At the other, the optimal policy prioritizes patients according to their marginal benefit from transplantation. Using real data, the authors show that, compared to the current UNOS policy, their proposed policy increases total QALYs, significantly reducing both number of wasted livers and deaths after transplant. The bullwhip effect, or demand information distortion, has been a subject of both theoretical and empirical studies in the operations management literature. In “Bullwhip Effect Measurement and Its Implications,” L. Chen and H. L. Lee develop a simple set of formulas that describe the traditional bullwhip measure as a combined outcome of several important drivers, such as finite capacity, batch ordering, and seasonality. Their modeling framework features certain plausible approximations that are commonly employed in practical inventory systems. The results can be used to explain various conflicting observations in previous empirical studies. Building on the theoretical framework, the authors discuss the managerial implications of the bullwhip measurement and show that it can be completely noninformative about the underlying supply chain cost performance if it is not linked to the operational details, such as decision intervals and lead times. When shipping charges are incurred on a per-truck basis, the ordering cost depends on the total number of trucks used to deliver the units. During loading and off-loading, orders exceeding certain quantity limits require additional crews, and the labor costs increase with each crew assigned. Some transportation contracts explicitly consider those incremental costs and impose a monetary penalty for order sizes exceeding the contracted volume. How should companies incorporate such complex cost schemes into their optimal inventory strategy? In “Optimal Ordering Policies for Periodic-Review Inventory Systems with Quantity-Dependent Fixed Costs,” O. Caliskan-Demirag, Y. Chen, and Y. Yang develop models with different fixed-cost structures that generalize some of the other forms in the literature. For the step-function cost structure and its special cases, they provide the partial characterizations of the optimal ordering policies that minimize the firms' total costs. The study develops results and insights about optimal inventory control policy under general fixed cost structures. In “On Optimal Policies for Inventory Systems with Batch Ordering,” W. T. Huh and G. Janakiraman study the problem of optimizing inventory investments in a supply chain and achieving good service in the face of uncertain demand. The service dimension is modeled by including a shortage cost when demand exceeds supply. The authors demonstrate that when replenishment orders at every stage of the supply chain are restricted to batches (whereas customer demand is not) the best inventory strategy is to order enough batches at each stage to raise inventory above a predetermined stage-specific target level. In “Strategies for a Centralized Single Product Multi-Class M/G/1 Make-to-Stock Queue,” H. Abouee-Mehrizi, B. Balcıoğlu, and O. Baron analyze an inventory system serving different priority classes. Unlike previous studies in this popular research area, they consider general production times, which render earlier analysis inapplicable. Not surprisingly, the optimal inventory allocation and production policy for their problem is unknown. The authors analyze the first-come-first-served (FCFS), strict priority (SP), and multilevel rationing (MR) policies. They originated the idea of analyzing M/G/1 queues with priorities and different arrival rates using the customer composition, i.e., the proportion of customers of each class to the total number of customers in the queue. Using this approach, they obtain the system cost under each policy. Their comparative study demonstrates that the MR policy is superior to the FCFS and SP policies. Following a mass-casualty event, medical resources (such as ambulances and operating rooms) can be overwhelmed by the sudden jump in demand. Current triage protocols determine patients' priority level based only on their injuries. However, recent work suggests that a proper triage procedure should also account for resource limitations and the event's scale. In “Priority Assignment in Emergency Response,” E. Uzun Jacobson, N. T. Argon, and S. Ziya model the mass-casualty triage problem as a clearing model with multiple classes of impatient jobs, and analyze it using sample-path methods and stochastic dynamic programming. They identify conditions under which information on resource limitations is not needed for prioritization decisions. However, in the absence of such conditions, the optimal triage decision may depend on the event's size and the number of resources. In particular, when resources are severely limited in comparison with the demand, less urgent patients with higher chances of survival should be given priority. Sales reveal information about consumer tastes. However, because most retailers sell an assortment of substitutable products, the quality of this information depends on consumer choice behavior. Conditional on the assortment offered, the more consumers substitute away from their ideal product, the less a retailer can learn from sales. How then should a retailer trade off long-term gains from gathering information about consumer tastes against immediate profits? In “Learning Consumer Tastes Through Dynamic Assortments,” C. Ulu, D. Honhon, and A. Alptekinoğlu study the informativeness of assortments for horizontally differentiated products and characterize optimal dynamic assortments over time. Their main finding is that the optimal assortment in a given period cannot be less informative than the one that would have been chosen had the retailer received perfect information about consumer tastes. Dynamic adverse selection problems often occur in supply chain management, revenue management, and healthcare management, among other areas. In such a problem, a principal (employer, owner, firm, etc.) tries to obtain certain key information held privately by an agent (employee, manager, customer, etc.), which evolves over the course of the long-term interaction of the two parties. The evolution of the private information adds great complexity to the problem. Drawing from recent developments in the study of partially observable Markov decision processes, H. Zhang proposes a new algorithm in “Solving an Infinite Horizon Adverse Selection Model Through Finite Policy Graphs,” which outperforms a typical algorithm based on value iteration. In “Robust Assortment Optimization in Revenue Management Under the Multinomial Logit Choice Model,” P. Rusmevichientong and H. Topaloglu propose methods for finding an effective assortment of products to offer to customers when there is uncertainty in the demand model. Customers are assumed to choose products according to a multinomial logit choice model, but the true parameters of the logit model are unknown. To capture the uncertainty in the demand model, the authors represent the set of likely parameter values by a compact uncertainty set. The objective is to find an assortment that maximizes the worst-case revenue over all parameter values in the uncertainty set. They give a complete characterization of the optimal policy. Their proposed method is especially beneficial when there is significant uncertainty in the parameter values, yielding over 10% improvement in the worst-case performance, while maintaining comparable average revenue if average revenue is the performance measure of interest. The ubiquity of online social networking communities, such as Facebook and Twitter, has enabled the collection of vast amounts of data on the structure and intensity of social interactions. This motivates the question of whether firms can intelligently use the available data to improve their business strategies. In “Optimal Pricing in Networks with Externalities,” O. Candogan, K. Bimpikis, and A. Ozdaglar study optimal pricing strategies of a seller that has access to social network data. They consider three different pricing strategies for the seller: implementing perfect price discrimination, offering a single uniform price, and offering discounts to a subset o"

ManshadiVahideh2018DiRN,,Diffusion in Random Networks: Impact of Degree Distribution,"Manshadi, Vahideh and Misra, Sidhant and Rodilitz, Scott",2018,,,,1-Jan,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA","Word of Mouth (WoM) is known as a powerful marketing force, as numerous empirical studies reveal that consumers' purchasing decisions are based on the advice of those in their social networks rather than on direct advertising. A recent international survey by Nielsen reports that 92% of consumers around the world count on recommendations from friends and family more than all other forms of advertising. With technological advances in online communications that enable consumers to easily share their experience with their ""friends,"" the effect and importance of WoM has only grown. In this new era, firms not only harness the power of WoM, but also improve its efficacy by targeting consumers based on the wealth of information available about their online activities. In particular, firms can utilize information on connections among consumers (1) to predict the diffusion trajectory (for both time and cost), and (2) to devise effective seeding strategies to impact the trajectory. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to study the diffusion process for a general class of network models and drive insights on the impact of heterogeneity in the degree of connections on the cost and speed of diffusion as well as on optimal seeding strategies. To this end, we study a diffusion process of a new product that spreads through the contacts that adopters make with their neighbors. In particular, we assume that an adopter makes contact with each of her neighbors according to an independent Poisson process with rate γ. We assume that the network underlying the connections is a random network with a given degree distribution. This general class of network models has been extensively used in the study of social networks, and it serves as the network model when the firm's knowledge about the pattern of connections is limited to the degree of each agent, rather that having access to the identity of every neighbor of an agent. In our setting, the firm incurs a fixed cost c for each contact by an adopter. Further, we assume that the firm has a budget for seeding. In particular, prior to the adoption process, he can directly contact a fraction q > 0 of agents, who become adopters. The firm decides who to seed with the goal of minimizing the total cost or the total time to reach his target proportion of adopters. Targeting agents based on social network information is a common practice. It has been studied in network economics literature in monopolistic settings as well as in competitive settings, mainly under the assumption that the firm has complete information about the network structure. However, in our setting the firm can only target based on the degree of an agent, since he does not have access to more detailed information. Seeding agents based on their degrees seems to be more practical (as it requires the firm to acquire much less information), and empirically it has been shown to be effective. Summary of Our Contributions: In the above setting, (1) We compute the cost and time to reach any adoption proportion q < s < 1, for any general bounded degree distribution in the limit as the number of agents grows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exact characterization of the diffusion process for such a general class of degree distributions. The other exact characterizations are for the special cases of a complete network, which is equivalent to the Bass model, and a one-dimensional grid (i.e., a cycle). (2) Using our exact characterization, we study the impact of degree distribution on the cost and time to reach any adoption proportion q < s < 1 and demonstrate a trade-off between contact cost and speed. In particular, we show that lower variability in the degree distribution results in lower cost. Fixing the average degree k ∈ N, the most cost-efficient network (to reach any adoption fraction s) is the k-regular network. The impact of degree distribution on timing is more involved, as it depends on the target adoption level (i.e., s) as well as higher moments of the degree distribution. However, our numerical analysis suggests that unless the target level is very high (e.g., s = 0.9), higher variance improves the speed. (3) We also study the problem of optimal seeding that the firm faces for a network with a given degree distribution. Somewhat contrary to the general wisdom, we show that the optimal strategy does not necessarily entail seeding high degree agents. In fact, we prove that for the objective of minimizing cost (to achieve any target level of adoption), the optimal strategy is to maximally seed low degree agents. For the objective of minimizing time, the optimal strategy depends on the target level s and on the seeding budget q. We present examples illustrating that the optimal strategy can be to seed a mixture of high and low degree agents. (4) In the absence of seeding, diffusion has a very slow start simply because there are not enough adopters to make contacts. We also study diffusion in such a setting by assuming that the diffusion starts with a single (randomly selected) agent. We characterize the cost and time it takes to reach α log(n) adopters, where n is the number of agents in the network, and α > 0 is a constant. We call this phase of diffusion the early adoption regime. We provide comparative statics with respect to the degree distribution in the early adoption regime, and we show that the cost is independent of degree distribution. Further, the time to diffuse to α log(n) adopters only depends on the first two moments of the degree distribution. Fixing the average degree, the time decreases as variance increases.1"
HemmatiMona2021TRoU,,The Role of Urbanization in Resilience of Communities under Flood Risk,"Hemmati, Mona",2021,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Flood risk is on the rise worldwide due to climate change and urbanization. Although urbanization has a significant role in placing the lives and livelihoods of people at flood risk, it has received less attention in comparison to climate change. Urbanization is expected to increase in the future; based on a report by the United Nations, 68% of the world population is expected to live in urban areas by 2050 compared to 50% in 2020. Perceptions of economic opportunity, accessibility to recreational facilities, and agricultural development have made floodplains and coastal areas desirable places to live. The nature of the risk brought about by urbanization in flood-prone areas must be thoroughly understood to develop effective policies for mitigating risk in rapidly growing flood-prone communities. This dissertation aims at understanding the effect of urbanization on future flood risk and how policymakers can integrate nonstructural flood mitigation measures, in terms of urban planning policies and socioeconomic incentives, in their urban development plans to help future communities move toward resilience. We begin by conducting a comprehensive literature review of how current studies have tackled the impact of urbanization on hazard and exposure components of flood risk through alternative policies. Since urban development plans are among the most influential factors in shaping the growth of a community over time, we evaluate these studies through the lens of how effective these policies have been in controlling the flood consequences. In this first step, we also identify some of the gaps and challenges in current flood risk mitigation planning and suggest a path forward, which will be considered in the upcoming sections of this dissertation. Next, we introduce a new approach to assess the effect of urbanization on future flood risk. The objectives of this step are to: (1) establish a framework for flood risk assessment to account for the impact of urbanization on flood risk; (2) develop a spatial model for simulating the growth of a community over time, considering geographical, physical, social, and economic factors associated with urbanization; and (3) evaluate the role of land-use policies and socioeconomic incentives, such as acquisition, zoning, and taxation in mitigating flood consequences. We believe that this methodology could be used to assist city planners and stakeholders in examining tradeoffs between costs and benefits of future land development, considering uncertainties in flood hazards, the performance of the built environment, and population and economic growth. Finally, we demonstrate how changes in human behavior affect urbanization and flood risk. To do so, we show how human behavior impacts urbanization by modeling the principal agents and their interactions that lead to changes in the urban expansion of a community over time. We evaluate how the risk perception of households affects their decision as to where to locate. Then, we investigate the driving factors and incentives in human decision-making on locational choices and how these incentives can be adopted by local authorities and policymakers as nonstructural flood mitigation measures to shape urbanization and to achieve resilient and sustainable development of urban communities."
GoldsmithPeterDaniel1995Bbaa,,Business behavior as a function of business structure: A transaction theory of cooperative firms,"Goldsmith, Peter Daniel",1995,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"A comprehensive theory of cooperative firms that answers its boundary questions has been an elusive problem for cooperative theorists. The boundary questions, conceptualized by Coase, ask, first, how the firm comes into existence and, second, how the firm selects its end-bounds, the level of integration. Traditional neoclassical theories assume a priori the existence of ""the firm,"" its technology and markets. Firms and markets then are not only exogenous institutions but are complements of each other. This research employs and expands transaction logic, developing a transaction theory of cooperative firm behavior that explains the cooperative's boundary behavior. The theory posits that firm and markets are endogenous economic organisms and are not complements but substitutes. Economizing agents (farmers) solve a ""tradeoff"" problem by employing a transaction theoretic decision rule when facing the boundary issues. The decision for cooperatives of whether to integrate or defer to the market begins at t = 0 at the farm level when agents decide to form a collective unit. An end-boundary decision occurs as the cooperative determines its place within the marketing chain and its role vis-a-vis the expectations of its owner-patrons. Empirically the end-boundary decision is witnessed in the international trade environment within the food and beverage (F&B) industry. The industry comprises a cross section of cooperatives and investor-owned firms (IOFs). In the area of international trade, firms have a spectrum of governance structures under which to deliver goods to foreign markets. Firms can choose low risk-low return alternatives to deliver goods, taking greater advantage of the market, i.e, exporting and licensing. Or they can internalize the transaction by taking an ownership position that involves higher risks and higher returns and utilizes, for example, a foreign direct investment (DFI) strategy. Cooperative firms consistently opt for market-based mechanisms and cease to integrate downstream in the international F&B industry. Their IOF competitors, on the other hand, may employ an integrated approach and invest directly. This research develops an original international trade governance model (ITG) using a dichotomous choice nested logit technique to estimate the determinants of (1) becoming an international firm (or remaining a domestic firm) and (2) an exporting or DFI strategy, for firms that have decided to ""go international."" The results displayed the importance of modeling a two-step ITG decision process. This avoids the specificity problem of confounding the international decision with the governance structure decision. Consistent with the theoretical model, firm size, country of origin GDP and degree of product differentiation were significant positive determinants of the decision to become an international firm. Cooperative corporate structure, inventory levels and debt-load positively affected the decision to export. Size, level of product differentiation, country of origin GDP and R&D were significant and positive determinants of a DFI strategy. Results showed that business behavior is in part a function of business structure. While its business structure did prohibit cooperatives from engaging in foreign trade, it did not prohibit them from entering the international market."
cdi_epfl_infoscience_oai_infoscience_epfl_ch_262814,,Essays in Financial Economics,"Blatt, Julien Arsène",,,,,,,,"Lausanne, EPFL",,"I started my PhD studies in August 2014 with a strong desire to push my own limits without knowing precisely the areas I wanted to cover in detail. To me, it was clear that I was interested by many different fields, however, I was particularly concerned with behavioural finance and with the fact that simple actions could be followed by strong market reactions. It is in this context that my supervisor, Prof. Semyon Malamud, advised me to derive/measure the consequences of the large acceptance of the RiskMetrics variance model on the price of financial assets. Indeed, this method has the advantage of providing a simple formula to estimate the volatility of any financial asset, but above all, has been used significantly by practitioners in the financial industry. The question then arises, ``Is there a link between this method and the price of financial assets?'' In order to answer this question, I have designed a simple portfolio optimization model in which agents update volatility estimates with the RiskMetrics formula. Thanks to this simple idea my first project was born and I quickly realized that I could design an elegant model. With this framework I have been able to establish the existence of a risk factor of which the economic literature was unaware. Moreover, the empirical strategy allows me to estimate the relative risk aversion coefficient independently from established procedures. Importantly, my estimates are in line with the ones obtained with these (standard) approaches. Meanwhile, I was also interested in a topic that covers a large part of all trades and is known as ``over-the-counter markets''. These markets are characterized by their high level of decentralization. Indeed, every transaction is settled directly between a buyer and a seller. In these markets, the only way to secure a trade is to find another agent that is willing to take the counter-party. I became very interested in a series of books and articles that were modeling financial assets traded under these conditions. Hence, I have started to work in this field by solving different models. I was particularly interested in understanding how the price of assets traded with this constraint would react under stressful situations, that is, when agents had to liquidate their investments. After a trial and error process, I found that my model generated puzzling results. Indeed, this model made predictions that were against traditional wisdom. Above all, that model predicted that a large level of capital mobility could impair welfare. Hence, I had eventually found the link between all the fields I wanted to cover in my thesis, where I debate the optimal allocation of capital under different types of frictions. While my first article treats the case of a centralized market with an agent who forecasts volatility using a particular method, the second article concerns how capital flows across markets when agents are subject to searching frictions. My third article is based on the second and discusses the interaction between innovation and the competition between firms supplying the same products. This article focuses on how capital is used by firms to innovate and how firms grow."
WostoupalBenjamin2018IWRM,,"Integrated Water Resources Management Under Uncertainty: Exploring Interconnected Technological, Infrastructural and Institutional Solutions","Wostoupal, Benjamin",2018,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Rapidly growing populations in many of the world’s semiarid regions intensify competition for increasingly scarce freshwater resources. Growing urban demands, land-use change, and a changing climate will further exacerbate regional vulnerability to water scarcity. The intensification of these trends creates several challenges for the future planning and management of water resources. In this work we employ the use of an integrated socioeconomic, hydrologic, and ecological modeling framework to quantify the effects of water rights allocation on a representative semiarid river basin. Through this framework we analyze the tradeoffs of several water management practices, institutional settings, and regional policies on municipal and agricultural sectors. Generally, the agent-based adoption of water management strategies can alleviate the harm of water scarcity while providing positive feedbacks to reducing municipal costs and increasing agricultural profit from production. Household adoption of xeriscaping is considered the most important technology to lower urban demands and offset the negative externalities of rural-to-urban water transfers. Additionally, an uninhibited water market leads to the most effective allocation of water rights, providing benefits to both rural and municipal communities. The future allocation of water rights under climatic, institutional, agricultural, and technological uncertainty shows significant sensitivity to fluctuations in water conveyance infrastructure costs. Such changes in infrastructure costs (i.e. 50% to 150%) can nearly double the expected costs of reliably supplying water to urban households. However, urban water supply planners can incentivize the adoption of water management practices to stabilize these costs. Further, required water purchases for land developers set by urban planners can be used as a key policy tool for keeping costs low. This work contributes to existing literature in integrated water resources management to help understand the effects of water scarcity and provide practical solutions for urban water planners in rapidly urbanizing semiarid regions."

DaubermanJamie2010Mdas,,Making decisions about screening cargo containers for nuclear threats using decision analysis and optimization,"Dauberman, Jamie",2010,,,,,,,VCU Scholars Compass,,"One of the most pressing concerns in homeland security is the illegal passing of weapons-grade nuclear material through the borders of the United States. If terrorists can gather the materials needed to construct a nuclear bomb or radiological dispersion device (RDD, i.e., dirty bomb) while inside the United States, the consequences would be devastating. Preventing plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), tritium gas or other materials that can be used to construct a nuclear weapon from illegally entering the United States is an area of vital concern. There are enormous economic consequences when our nation's port security system is compromised. Interdicting nuclear material being smuggled into the United States on cargo containers is an issue of vital national interest, since it is a critical aspect of protecting the United States from nuclear attacks. However, the efforts made to prevent nuclear material from entering the United States via cargo containers have been disjoint, piecemeal, and reactive, not the result of coordinated, systematic planning and analysis. Our economic well-being is intrinsically linked with the success and security of the international trade system. International trade accounts for more than thirty percent of the United States economy (Rooney, 2005). Ninety-five percent of international goods that enter the United States come through one of 361 ports, adding up to more than 11.4 million containers every year (Fritelli, 2005; Rooney, 2005; US DOT, 2007). Port security has emerged as a critically important yet vulnerable component in the homeland security system. Applying game theoretic methods to counterterrorism provides a structured technique for defenders to analyzing the way adversaries will interact under different circumstances and scenarios. This way of thinking is somewhat counterintuitive, but is an extremely useful tool in analyzing potential strategies for defenders. Decision analysis can handle very large and complex problems by integrating multiple perspectives and providing a structured process in evaluating preferences and values from the individuals involved. The process can still ensure that the decision still focuses on achieving the fundamental objectives. In the decision analysis process value tradeoffs are evaluated to review alternatives and attitudes to risk can be quantified to help the decision maker understand what aspects of the problem are not under their control. Most of all decision analysis provides insight that may not have been captured or fully understood if decision analysis was not incorporated into the decision making process. All of these factors make decision analysis essentially to making an informed decision. Game theory and decision analysis both play important roles in counterterrorism efforts. However, they both have their weaknesses. Decision analysis techniques such as probabilistic risk analysis can provide incorrect assessments of risk when modeling intelligent adversaries as uncertain hazards. Game theory analysis also has limitations. For example when analyzing a terrorist or terrorist group using game theory we can only take into consideration one aspect of the problem to optimize at a time. Meaning the analysis is either analyzing the problem from the defenders perspective or from the attacker’s perspective. Parnell et al. (2009) was able to develop a model that simultaneously maximizes the effects of the terrorist and minimizes the consequences for the defender. The question this thesis aims to answer is whether investing in new detector technology for screening cargo containers is a worthwhile investment for protecting our country from a terrorist attack. This thesis introduces an intelligent adversary risk analysis model for determining whether to use new radiological screening technologies at our nation’s ports. This technique provides a more realistic risk assessment of the true situation being modeled and determines whether it is cost effective for our country to invest in new cargo container screening technology. The optimal decision determined by our model is for the United States to invest in a new detector, and for the terrorists to choose agent cobalt-60, shown in Figure 18. This is mainly due to the prominence of false alarms and the high costs associated with screening all of these false alarms, and we assume for every cargo container that sounds an alarm, that container is physically inspected. With the new detector technology the prominence of false alarms decreases and the true alarm rate increases, the cost savings associated with this change in the new technology outweighs the cost of technical success or failure. Since the United States is attempting to minimize their expected cost per container, the optimal choice is to invest in the new detector. Our intelligent adversary risk analysis model can simultaneously determine the best decision for the United States, who is trying to minimize the expected cost, and the terrorist, who is trying to maximize the expected cost to the United States. Simultaneously modeling the decisions of the defender and attacker provides a more accurate picture of reality and could provide important insights to the real situation that may have been missed with other techniques. The model is extremely sensitive to certain inputs and parameters, even though the values are in line with what is available in the literature, it is important to understand the sensitivities. Two inputs that were found to be particularly important are the expected cost for physically inspecting a cargo container, and the cost of implementing the technology needed for the new screening device. Using this model the decision maker can construct more accurate judgments based on the true situation. This increase in accuracy could save lives with the decisions being made. The model can also help the decision maker understand the interdependencies of the model and visually see how his resource allocations affect the optimal decisions of the defender and the attacker."
McCarneyGeoffreyR2006IOAM,,IMPLICATIONS OF A MARKET FOR CARBON ON TIMBER AND NON-TIMBER VALUES IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD,"McCarney, Geoffrey R and Armstrong, Glen W and Adamowicz, Wiktor L",2006,,,,,,,,,"Despite considerable interest in the potential for forests to sequester carbon, the impact of carbon management on the provision of timber and non-timber resources has received relatively little attention in the literature. The introduction of value for stored carbon may result in modifications to traditional forest management objectives, generating trade-offs with other forest resources depending on the incentives provided by carbon markets. This paper investigates these issues by examining the impact of a particular form of carbon market on timber and non-timber values in a managed forest. An integrated modeling framework, developed for the incorporation of carbon management into operational timber management modeling tools, is also described. There is still substantial debate over how to properly credit carbon sequestered in forests. To date, there has been little research on how the form of a carbon market will impact the operations and objectives of forestry firms. Alternative market structures could produce very different responses in terms of rotation age, net present value and harvest policy. Here, a specific form of carbon market, the specified level contract, is investigated. Forestry firms are assumed to reach contracts with carbon-seeking agents which ""guarantee"" that a specified level of carbon stock will be maintained over a defined time period. Optimal forest management decisions are examined by implementing an optimization model for a specific land base in Alberta. The Woodstock forest modeling package is used for optimization. Analysis of trade-offs is based on the work of Armstrong et al. (1999, 2003) which assess non-timber resources using the natural disturbance approach to forest management. The analysis is then expanded to include a more rigorous, and realistic, depiction of carbon and carbon stock changes. Using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3), carbon yield curves are developed which are integrated directly into the Woodstock forest management ii model. These carbon yields capture dynamics specific to separate biomass and dead organic matter (DOM) carbon pools and are represented for individual forest cover types. Interestingly, the inclusion of DOM carbon generates unexpected relationships between non-timber resources and incentives to sequester carbon. Results show that the presence of co-benefits will depend upon forest cover type, the harvest flow regulation faced by the managing firm and the incentives for timber supply provided by the market. Furthermore, firms that agree to enter contracts for carbon sequestration appear to do so at the expense of a decline in timber supply, with estimates of the opportunity cost of carbon management falling within the range of those found in recent literature."
BugarinMirtaN.S1997Eide,,Essays in dynamic economies,"Bugarin, Mirta N. S",1997,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The dynamic stochastic computational general equilibrium modeling approach uses the neoclassical growth model to analyze aggregate macroeconomic fluctuations. This method was extended to a large subclass of economies for which the second Welfare Theorem fails to hold. For these economies where competitive equilibria are not Pareto optimal (e.g., due to the introduction of distorting proportional income taxes, a cash-in-advance constraint or heterogeneous agents), the methodology can be used whenever the model economy fluctuates around a steady state and has local dynamics that can be well approximated by a linear law of motion. The first essay extends the application of this approach to a model economy distorted by progressive taxation. The progressive taxes on labor income generate a kink in the agent's per period budget set, hence a piece-wise linear quadratic value function is derived. Based on the fact that for the considered model economy the state space is divided into the same (two) intervals for any period, a recursive competitive equilibrium can be computed as a maximization of the value function between the two piece-wise linear quadratic functions. The second essay studies the distributional as well as welfare implication of the inflation tax using a heterogeneous agents growth model that mimics some characteristics of the Brazilian economy. The key findings show that heterogeneity leads to a stronger welfare cost of inflation in terms of aggregate per capita output. Moreover, if the inflation tax is replaced in a revenue neutral way by other alternative distortional income tax regimes, a trade-off between welfare superior and equity improving outcomes becomes apparent."

The human brain, the organic seat of creativity, is generally recognized as one of the most complicated complex adaptive systems in experience. The creative process requires that the brain access elements of both order and chaos inherent in its own functioning. Copyright law may not directly touch the internal processes that produce creativity, but it does influence the environment in which the creative process occurs. It offers economic security to creators, but also controls the information available to the creative brain and the circumstances under which that information can be used. Copyright law itself has historically encompassed elements that both provide order and allow for some creative chaos, though it increasingly leans toward order."

The combination of such understanding with advanced flow and transport modeling establishes the link between cause and effect, thereby, directing operators to optimal design and construction of new heaps. Modeling of flow and transport in heaps could also point to a unique change in application method or rate that would maximize leaching enhancement of an existing heap under existing situation and leaching history. The use of such a model is cost effective in that it can simulate multiple scenarios of alternative leaching enhancement methods. By simulating a large number of irrigation scenarios, such a model can point to the optimal and/or the most promising alternatives for a particular heap. The authors' simulations concentrate on the effects of changes in application rates and heap design on changes in flow paths and enhanced leaching recovery. Based on such simulations, an intelligent control agent, such as Multiple Resolution Decision-Support System (MRDS) (Meystel and Albus, 2002), could build a new representation of the complex heap-leaching system. And, by learning from historical data and current information, it could provide optimal management of heap leaching and heap decommissioning."

PaltsevSergeyV2001Geao,,General equilibrium assessment of public policy issues in the Newly Independent States,"Paltsev, Sergey V",2001,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This thesis examines several aspects of public policy in the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union. The dissertation consists of three essays that explore the problems of taxation, environmental policy, and pension reform. Each of these analyses employs computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling. While each essay is unique in its contribution, all are linked by their focus on the problems of public policies for countries that are moving from a period of heavy government control toward lessened state intervention, increased privatization, and greater use of competition. A short description of the NIS economies in transition and an outline of the CGE approach are given in Chapter One. Chapter Two examines the welfare effect of raising additional tax revenue from alternative tax instruments. A static CGE model based on a recent Russian input-output table is developed to analyze marginal cost of public funds and marginal excess burdens of different taxes. The welfare cost of taxation is relatively high in Russia. The marginal cost of funds is between 17% for the labor tax and 96% for the import tax, which is the least efficient source of public funds. Output tax and VAT have the MCF of around 75%. An assumption about elasticities plays an important role in the MCF calculation. Higher values of elasticities imply more responsive behavior of economic agents when taxes are changed. An excess burden of taxation arises when a behavior of economic agents changes due to introduction of taxes, and the excess burden is bigger when behavior changes to a greater degree. The marginal welfare costs are greater for activities which face high or widely varying tax rates. Chapter Three explores the issue of international trading of carbon emissions permits. According to the Kyoto Protocol, Russia and Ukraine have emissions obligations that appear to be in excess of their anticipated emissions as a result of economic downturn. This excess is referred to as “hot air”, and could be traded with other countries. NIS countries unambiguously lose from the EU proposal, which is motivated by a stated preference for higher domestic abatement activities. The proposal imposes a ceiling on the amount of traded emission permits and lead to global welfare losses. NIS alone cannot impose a credible threat of removing itself from the Kyoto agreement if the EU proposal were ratified. However, an alliance with the other signatory countries who experience high mitigation costs and who want to exploit full efficiency of free trade in carbon permits makes adoption of the EU proposal questionable. Pension reform analysis by international donor organizations is usually done with actuarial models. Chapter Four analyses sensitivity of actuarial models to different economic and demographic trends. Failure to account for demographic-economic interactions leads to biased forecasts. Pension reform options for transitional countries are highly limited, due to the near absence of capital markets, the collapse of formal sector employment, and huge differences between urban and rural sectors. The disparate results from projections made under different assumptions imply that policymakers should examine the realism of policy suggestions and associated actuarial forecasts very carefully. The final chapter provides concluding remarks and directions for future research."

AndresB2020ASAA,,A Strategies Alignment Approach to Manage Disruptive Events in Collaborative Networks,"Andres, B and Marcucci, Giulio",2020,,,,,,,MDPI AG,,"[EN] Enterprises of the supply chain are currently embedded in dynamic and turbulent environments, having to deal with the appearance of disruptive events. When an enterprise is affected by a disruptive event, the consequences of the disruption not only impact in the enterprise itself, but also influences on the other partners of the network to which it belongs. Thus, disruptive events exceed the capability of individual actors, impacting on the network performance. Consequently, network partners have to collaboratively make decisions to soften the negative impacts on the performance. In this regard, after a disruption takes place, network enterprises should be aware of activating a set of sustainable and resilience strategies that attenuate the performance loss and reduce the disruption recovery time. Nevertheless, the diverse nature of disruptions means that a wide range of varied and sometimes contradictory strategies can be formulated, resulting in conflict situations among the collaborative network (CN) partners. The current paper proposes an approach that makes it possible to collaboratively manage the strategies to activate when a disruptive event occurs, so that the selected strategies are aligned. The strategies alignment approach, proposed in the paper, makes it possible to select those strategies that have a positive impact, or a minimum negative impact, on the objectives defined, not only in the enterprise itself, but also in the objectives defined by the rest of CN partners. The alignment of strategies makes it possible to reduce the performance level loss when a disruption takes place. Thus, the strategies alignment approach aims at activating those strategies that maximize the performance of the CN, achieving levels of performance equal or higher than the levels previous to the disruption, limiting the adverse effects produced by the disruptive events, and contributing to a more sustainable-resilient CN. Finally, in order to validate the proposal, a case study is presented. The proposed model is validated to deal with a drop in demand due to a political embargo, in a textile CN.

BucacosIguiniElizabeth1996Maia,,Macrodynamic adjustment in a small open economy: Real exchange rate target zones and money demand in Uruguay,"Bucacos Iguini, Elizabeth",1996,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The dynamics of macroeconomic adjustments in a small open economy are addressed from three different perspectives and empirically evaluated with Uruguayan data. First, the purchasing power parity (PPP) hypothesis in the long run is tested. Second, real exchange rate target zones are analyzed. Third, money demand with error-correction models (ECM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) methods are examined. The first paper focuses on the time series characteristics of the real (effective) exchange rate (REER) between Uruguay and its main trade partners, which have been affected by a one-time (multiple) change(s) in their levels. Common violations of implicit assumptions in econometric models--such as a autocorrelation, conditional heteroskedasticity, non-normality, and other forms of nonlinearities--indicate the convenience of applying data-based non parametric techniques in modeling the REER's. The second paper analyzes the arguments in favor of exchange rate finite bands, instead of completely fixed ones, for the real exchange rate (RER), and simulates the nature and amount of monetary independence with Uruguayan data. The exploitation of the mean reversion property of the RER relative to central parity, its long-run mean, assures the central bank would be required to do only intra-marginal leaning-against-wind interventions to defend the RER bands. This gives the central bank some kind of monetary independence, even with free capital mobility. The third paper examines money demand in Uruguay with error-correction models and artificial neural network methods. The purpose is to approximate more accurately the ""true"" underlying functional forms for the long-run equilibrium demand for money and to estimate the learning process in the short-run adjustment of real money stocks. A hybrid model, with strong nonlinearities in the long-run money demand and a linear error-correction mechanism in the short run, seems to be the noe that best describes the way economic agents maintain money holdings. Long-run inflation and inflation tax combinations are generated by the estimated model. No Laffer curve is found, which suggests that although the inflation tax becomes progressively inefficient, higher inflation does not lead to perverse losses in seigniorage."

It is true that some people do not want to be called at dinnertime - ever. However, others do want to be sought out when there is a product or service they need. And telemarketing can reach them. Studies indicate that the technique can be very successful. According to the Washington-based American Teleservices Association, the telemarketing industry employs more than 8 million people in the US alone and generates an average return of $7.15 for every dollar invested. Using new data-modeling techniques, it is now possible to produce a list of prospective customers and predict the top 20% of respondents to your product or service and your brand of direct marketing. Combining this with customer relationship management technology allows telemarketers to be less intrusive in their quest to forge new relationships with potential customers."

At the beginning of period t, a new dividend dt is announced. For each agent i = 1, ..., N, the GA is invoked with probability 1/K to change an agent’s rule set Ti. Afterwards, agents determine their active rule set ωiTi by comparing the condition parts of each trading rule j = 1, ..., 100 with the binary market descriptor. From that active rule set, agents select the rule with the highest forecast accuracy for their forecast production. The price formation process is then initiated by the specialist who announces a trial price Ptrial equal to last period’s price. Based on this trial price, agents form their expectation about next period’s price and dividend, determine their optimal demand for the risky stock, and then submit their offers and bids to the specialist. If the bids and offers cannot be matched, the specialist determines a trial price and the whole process starts all over. This iterative process ends when the offers are balanced by the submitted bids or after 10 unsuccessful trial rounds. In the latter case, one side of the market will be proportionally rationed. The last trial price is announced to be the stock price for period t and all trades between agents are executed at that price. Since at this time, the dividend and the stock price in period t are known to the agents, they are now able to update the forecast performance of all rules which were activated in the last period and actually produced a forecast about this period’s price and dividend."
BattenDavidF.2000TAAo,,The Ancient Art of Learning by Circulating,"Batten, David F.",2000,,,,117-138,,,Routledge,,European history has always been a touchy subject. But few historians can match the stormy heights reached by the Belgian Henri Pirenne. At the heart of this enduring controversy are some of Pirenne’s ideas concerning the transition of Europe from classical antiquity to medieval civilization. A fascinating analytical sketch that shed some light on the questions was devised by the mathematician Alistair Mees. He analyzed the effect of increasing trade opportunities on urban and rural populations. The periodic peddling of goods by the oriental traders was slanted toward the silks of Constantinople and the spices of the Indies. This is hardly surprising since only goods of great rarity and profitability could withstand the burden of the high transportation costs and risks of loss that must have beset the early merchants. The Champagne fairs became the “embryonic clearinghouses” of the European economy. Four towns in the area developed a rotating system of six fairs each year.

MachadoEliaAxiniaMachado2011AVtD,,Assessing Vulnerability to Dengue Fever in Mexico under Global Change,"Machado, Elia Axinia Machado",2011,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"We live in an era of global change where human impacts on the structure and function of the Earth system have reached unprecedented dimensions, threatening the Earth's life support systems upon which the health and survival of all Earth's species depend. A growing body of literature has shown that demographic and societal changes in the last three decades have had a major impact on the increasing distribution and emergence of infectious diseases. Despite advances in medicine, the trends in emerging infectious diseases are worrisome: not only are we seeing the emergence of new infectious agents, but also the rebound of those once thought to be controlled, such as dengue fever. This three article dissertation is motivated by the urgent need to assess the impacts of global change on health, and particularly in the incidence and distribution of dengue fever. In particular, this research seeks to assess the trends of dengue fever in Mexico and to increase the understanding of the socio-economic and environmental factors shaping the differential vulnerability to dengue fever across space. To do so, this study adopts a global change vulnerability framework and integrates methodologies from GIScience, the climatic sciences and species distribution modeling. The first paper is entitled ""A robust nonparametric trend analysis of dengue fever in Mexico 1999–2006"", and provides a spatially explicit assessment of the temporal trends of dengue fever at the municipal scale based on the Mann-Kendall statistic and Theil-Sen slope estimator. The results show a small but steady increase of dengue fever incidence in 74% of the 998 municipalities that reported at least one dengue fever case during the study period. Three states 2 in southern Mexico concentrate the majority of the municipalities with stronger trends: Veracruz, Quintana Roo and Guerrero. The second paper is entitled ""Mapping vulnerability to dengue fever in Mexico using Species distribution modeling."" This study demonstrates an approach to map the vulnerability to dengue fever empirically using species distribution modeling, and examines the relative contribution of socio-economic and climatic variables to the distribution of dengue fever. Several models of dengue fever are compared using different variable selection methods. The patterns of dengue fever are consistent across models, showing higher levels of suitability to dengue fever in the low elevation coastal areas. At the scale of analysis of this study the climatic variables (specifically the minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation and mean temperature of the wettest quarter) are more important than the socio-economic variables for characterizing dengue fever risk in Mexico. The third paper is entitled ""Putting all together: An evaluation of the implications of composite index aggregation methods for decision making and vulnerability assessment of dengue fever in Mexico."" This paper examines commonly used methodologies used for creating vulnerability indices in the global change vulnerability literature and compares the results of applying five of them (Data Envelopment Analysis, Weighted Linear Combination, WLC with Fuzzy membership functions, MIN and MAX operators) to construct an index of vulnerability to dengue fever in Mexico. The results highlight the implications of using each methodology in terms of the spatial patterns of vulnerability but also in terms of the degree of trade off among the measures being combined and the degree of risk involved in the decision making process."
JacksonWilliamA.2019Toa,,The orthodox approach,"Jackson, William A.",2019,,,,24-Dec,,,Routledge,,"This chapter examines in further detail the orthodox approach to markets, along with the problems identified by critics and the limited attempts within the mainstream to address these problems. The orthodox approach to markets is based on the neoclassical theory that first appeared in the late nineteenth century and came to dominate economics in the twentieth century. Modern orthodox economics says nothing about classical political economy, on the premise that neoclassical theory has replaced classical. Teaching of economics proceeds in the style of natural sciences, where later theories supersede earlier ones as the discipline evolves. Pivotal to the orthodox approach is the rational individual trader attaining the best possible outcome. Agents in orthodox modelling have fixed preferences that predate involvement in the market and remain unaffected by trade. Many mainstream economists, conceding the unrealistic character of perfect competition, wish to insert greater realism into orthodox modelling."
QuennevilleNadine2008WMaC,,When Mobilization and Closeness Go Hand in Hand: The Determining Role of the Immediate Supervisor,"Quenneville, Nadine and Simard, Gilles and Bentein, Kathleen",2008,"Relations industrielles (Québec, Québec)",63,2,189-222,,,,,"This article presents the results of a study highlighting the role of perceived support & affective commitment in the relationship between the perception of three human resource management practices & two types of employee mobilization behaviors, as assessed by their supervisor. This study sought to explore the relationship between skills development practices, non-monetary recognition & information sharing, on the one hand, & mobilization behaviors in two categories or ""areas"" of performance, that is, behaviors related to work contract compliance & those related to high job performance, on the other. The concept of mobilization behaviors & its background will be presented in detail. This concept is part of a broader model, that of mobilizing human researches, which will also be presented. In light of research advances in this field, we measured two agents of support & commitment, that is, the supervisor & the organization. We chose management practices which are used in a discretionary manner by the organization but especially by supervisors. Indeed, deliberate intervention on the part of the supervisor increases the influence of these practices on the level of support perceived by employees. The social exchange & norm of reciprocity theories were used to explain the relationships between the different variables in our model. The social exchange theory helps to explain an employee's decision as to whether or not to contribute to the well-being of the organization in response to the exchange relationships that he or she has experienced at work. Based on the postulate of reciprocity, it is understood that employees tend to show affective commitment to the organization & the supervisor, insofar as they also perceive that the latter are committed to them. More specifically, through positive initiatives such as the implementation of human resource management practices, the organization & the supervisor foster perceived support by getting across the symbolic message to employees that they are valued & taken into consideration. In response to this perceived support, employees develop affective commitment, that is, an emotional attachment to the organization & the supervisor. It is therefore postulated that employees who perceive support from the organization & the supervisor, through the implementation of discretionary human resource practices, will feel a moral obligation to repay these benefits, by demonstrating affective commitment & adopting mobilization behaviors. In this regard, it is recognized that mobilization is above all fostered by significant reciprocity relationships which are maintained through moral & social debts. We thus studied two social exchange relationships, that between the employee & the organization, & that between the employee & the supervisor. We also hypothesize that an employee's commitment to the supervisor will lead him or her to display a greater number of mobilization behaviors related to work contract compliance, as these behaviors are likely to be particularly beneficial to the supervisor on a day-to-day basis. In order to eliminate common variance problems, we measured the employees' mobilization behaviors (related to work contract compliance & high job performance) through a supervisor questionnaire, & the explanatory variables through an employee questionnaire. Analyses were carried out on a sample of 222 employees & 38 supervisors in a Canadian retail chain. Relationships were determined using structural equation modeling with LISREL. We also established the discriminant validity of the constructs by comparing various measurement models using LISREL. Lastly, alternative models were developed in order to assess the mediating effects of support from & commitment to the organization & the supervisor. Our results show that a favorable perception of skills development, non-monetary recognition & information sharing was positively linked to the perception of organizational support. Of these three practices, only information sharing was not associated with the perception of organizational support through the perception of support from the supervisor. Skills development & non-monetary recognition, on the other hand. positively influenced the perception of support from the supervisor which, in turn, reinforced the perception of organizational support. The relationships between the perception of organizational support, affective organizational commitment & high job performance behaviors, as assessed, were significant, as were the relationships between the perception of support from the supervisor, affective commitment to the supervisor & behaviors related to work contract compliance & high job performance, as assessed. Lastly, the link between affective commitment to the supervisor & behaviors related to work contract compliance, as assessed, was stronger than that between affective organizational commitment & these same behaviors, as assessed. Comparing alternative models to the structural model proposed made it possible to gather evidence regarding the mediating role of affective organizational commitment & affective commitment to the supervisor in the relationship between the perception of organizational support, the perception of support from the supervisor & mobilization behaviors. We set out to assess the explanatory power of perceived support & affective commitment involved in the relationship between employees, their supervisor & the organization. Our conclusions indicate that the relationship between employees & their supervisor in the retail trade industry is significant & should be taken into consideration by organizations that wish to foster the mobilization of employees through various human resource practices. Thus, we discovered that in response to the quality of their relationship with their supervisor, employees adopt a wide range of mobilization behaviors. Tables, Figures, References.

Reengineering, and rethinking and radical redesign of internal processes calls for discarding current practices and reinventing better ways to supply products and services. Holistic thinking, cross-sectional configurations, proactive behaviour patterns, reward for innovation and creativity, and the demise of traditional infrastructures are essential for facilitating fluid social, economic and political trends into the 21st century. Educators must think differently about the purpose of schools and their delivery and redesign infrastructures which are built on shared values and beliefs, multiple interacting linkages and teamwork. School leaders are the catalysts for change and, working with the school's power agents and modeling expected behaviours, motivate teachers to replace the old culture with new processes of schooling. Shared ownership of case values, realistic and achievable goals and collaboration places the responsibility for creating a reengineered delivery system on teachers themselves."

The monetary services indexes are based on microeconomic models of consumer and firm decision making that do not impose strong ex ante assumptions regarding the elasticities of substitution among monetary assets. In addition to its consistency with other aggregation methods, a 2nd advantage of the index-number approach to monetary aggregation it that it produces internally consistent dual opportunity costs. The methodology is also consistent with the foundations of modern general-equilibrium business cycle theory, which often begins with the hypothesis of an optimizing agent. As a result, the monetary services indexes may be a particularly valuable improvement in measurement that complements innovations in economic business-cycle modeling."

Bernard et Marc Vielle Les trois articles visent à communiquer, d'une manière pédagogique autant que faire se peut, le résultat d'une expérience accumulée de plus de 4 ans. Le premier article, de nature théorique et méthodologique, a pour ambition de présenter le plus simplement possible les mécanismes principaux qui sont enjeu dans ce type de modélisation et qui résultent en particulier des effets de substitution entre biens ou entre facteurs (visés par les politiques économiques concernées), ainsi que des effets liés au commerce international qui s'apparentent plutôt à des effets de revenu (des transferts). Un élément fondamental de l'analyse économique est la mesure du coût des politiques, c'est-à-dire de la perte de bien-être qu'elles occasionnent aux agents économiques qui constituent à la fois la source de l'activité économique et son bénéficiaire privilégié, pour ne pas dire unique, à savoir les consommateurs finals. Les exemples traités, ainsi que les développements théoriques s'appuyant sur des modèles simples, ont pour objet de préciser les concepts de base et de faire apparaître les principaux facteurs qui rendent compte de la nature et de l'importance de ce coût économique. Le deuxième article présente de manière détaillée la structure du modèle et justifie les choix de modélisation effectués. Le lecteur pourra se rendre compte de la complexité formelle de ce genre de modèle - nécessaire car il faut qu'il soit exhaustif et cohérent - et de sa grande simplicité conceptuelle, puisqu'il s'agit en toute circonstance de décrire des marchés, c'est-à-dire des demandes, des offres, et les mécanismes d'équilibrage par les prix, tout en s'assurant que le circuit des revenus, sous-jacent au fonctionnement de ces marchés, est convenablement bouclé, dans le respect de la loi fondamentale de l'économie attribuée à Walras. Depuis sa première version de 1995, le modèle a fait l'objet de nombreuses utilisations et de plusieurs communications dans des congrès et séminaires. Ils visent à évaluer des politiques énergétiques soit nationales (le programme électro-nucléaire français), soit régionales ou internationales (la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre). L'application présentée dans le troisième article est de cette dernière nature et vise plus particulièrement à comparer les coûts économiques de différents dispositifs fiscaux permettant d'atteindre un objectif donné de réduction des émissions. Il permet de montrer et surtout de quantifier, dans un cadre national puis européen, combien peut entraîner de surcoûts un mauvais choix des instruments fiscaux. GEMINI-E3, A General National - International Economie, Energy and Environmental Equilibrium Model by Alain L. Bernard and Marc Vielle The three papers set out to present, in as educational a manner as possible, the findings of an experiment lasting over four years. The first theoretical and methodological paper gives as straightforward a presentation as possible of the main mechanisms at play in this type of model. These mechanisms derive particularly from substitution effects between goods and factors (targeted by the economic policies concerned) and international trade effects, which are more akin to income effects (transfers). A basic element of the economic analysis is the measurement of the cost of the policies, i.e. the loss of welfare to economic players who are both the source of economic activity and its main if not only beneficiary, i.e. the end user. The examples studied and the theoretical developments based on simple models clarify the basic concepts and identify the main factors accounting for the nature and extent of these economic costs. The second paper presents the model structure in detail and justifies the modeling choices made. It shows the formal complexity of this type of model - required for completeness and consistency - and its great conceptual simplicity. The model is used to describe markets, i.e. supply, demand and price balancing mechanisms, while ensuring that the income channel underlying the running of these markets is suitably reconciled in keeping with Walras's fundamental law of economics. The first 1995 version of the model was used in a number of cases and discussed in papers to conferences and seminars organised to evaluate national energy policies (the French nuclear power programme) and regional and international energy policies (the reduction in greenhouse effect emissions). The application presented in the third paper is of an international nature. It endeavours in particular to compare the economic costs of the different tax devices used to attain a given emissions reduction goal. It demonstrates and quantifies the potential extra costs provoked by a poor choice of tax instruments first at national and then at European level. Bernard Alain, Vielle Marc.

This alternative framework enables us to evaluate various implications of policy intervention in view of the nature and source of the initial shock to the system, and the initial conditions at the time of the shock. The approach is based on modeling the sectoral (allocative) impact of the M and F stabilization tools in the presence of structural disequilibrium (SD) and sectorally biased shocks (SBS) under the assumption of sluggish wage and price adjustment and positive costs of factor mobility. This approach to macro analysis facilitates better understanding of the dynamics underlying the macro phenomena and explains observations such as stagflation, fluctuations, and slow growth. It is shown that policy intervention in the presence of (SD) and/or (SBS) prevents smooth adjustment in markets experiencing current disequilibrium, leading to the accumulation of the disequilibrium components and the divergence of the relative rate of return of various factors from their underlying equilibrium values. This lead to the magnification of disequilibrium, thus accentuating the initial fluctuation or creating new fluctuation. Moreover, it is shown that any expansionary policy designed to reduce the level of unemployment below the level determined by the underlying market conditions, will result in further fluctuation in the form of stagflation. This result holds even if the current level of unemployment is at or greater than the natural rate level, and even in the presence of accelerating inflation. The welfare, growth, and other efficiency implications of active policy intervention are also examined. It is found that active stabilization in the presence of (SD) or (SBS) will generate net welfare costs, reduce the rate of implementation of new technologies and the rate of growth, and increase the natural rate of unemployment. Stagflation is shown to result from unexpected shifts in the relative (to GNP) size and composition of the government budget. The relevant structural characteristics of the economy are also considered. Downward wage rigidity and the asymmetry in upward and downward flexibility of wages and prices are further explained based on the maximizing behavior of agents and the characteristics of the market place. The existence of inherent inflationary or deflationary biases in the system, and of structurally induced Phillips trade-off are also investigated under alternative states of the world."
MumfordJohn2013BMPD,,Biosecurity Management Practices: Determining and delivering a response,"Mumford, John",2013,,,,105-119,,,Routledge,,"The management of biosecurity includes both preventative measures taken against potential perceived risks, which are based on formal risk assessments, and responsive measures taken as a result of the detection of outbreaks of harmful agents that have successfully entered a country. Because biosecurity requirements have implications for international trade they are governed by international standards and agreements. For plant health biosecurity affecting both agriculture and the environment, international standards cover pest risk analysis and risk management (FAO, 2004), and eradication actions (FAO, 1998). For animal health there are international standards on the veterinary inspection of exported animals and animal products, and diagnostic tests and control responses for all the major diseases of livestock (OIE, 2012a). The World Trade Organization (WTO) Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement 1 describes general principles for biosecurity regulations and a dispute settlement procedure. This chapter considers these different preventative and responsive management practices, including exclusion, quarantine, early detection, surveillance, eradication and control. It incorporates a consideration of risk profiling and the allocation of response resources using economic risk modelling. Finally it reviews the sometimes contentious issue of cost and responsibility sharing."
BeckJessicaMareile2008AHAt,,A Holistic Approach to Sustainability Analysis of Industrial Networks,"Beck, Jessica Mareile",2008,,,,,,,The University of Sydney,,"The aim of this thesis is to support the evaluation of sustainable development strategies for industrial networks in the context of industrial ecology (IE). Industrial networks are a group of units which carry out, or contribute to, industrial activity, and are connected by material and energy flows, but also capital and information exchanges. The components of an industrial network encompass resource extraction, processing and refining, forming and assembly, use, disposal, as well as recycling and reprocessing. The motivation behind this research is the realisation that much of the current environmental system analysis focus within IE lacks a structured approach to considering: •   system environment •    dynamic nature of the system and its environment •      economic and social impacts •   the effect of uncertainty on analysis outcomes. It is argued in this thesis that current environmental analysis approaches used in IE can be improved in their capacity to capture the complexity of industrial systems, with the objective of promoting sustainable development. While IE emphasises the benefit of a systems approach to identifying environmental strategies in industry, analysis tools have to date not engaged extensively with important aspects such as the influence of system environment and dynamics on the viability of an environmental strategy, or with the economic or social impacts of industrial system development, which are equally important for sustainable development. Nor is the assessment of the effect of uncertainty on analysis outcomes an integral part of environmental analysis tools in IE. This is particularly significant when, in fact, the degree of uncertainty in assumptions and data used increases with the scope, and therefore the abstraction, of the system under consideration. IE will have to engage with the network and contextual complexities to a greater degree if it is to evolve from a concept to the application of its principles in practice. The main contribution of this thesis is therefore the development of a structured approach to analysing industrial networks for the purpose of identifying strategies to encourage sustainable development, while accounting for the complexity of the underlying system as well as the problem context. This analysis is intended to allow the identification of preferred network development pathways and to test the effectiveness of sustainable development strategies. A top-down, prescriptive approach is adopted for this purpose. This approach is chosen as the industrial network analysis is intended to identify how a network should develop, rather than focusing on how it could develop. Industrial networks are systems which are complex in both their structure and behaviour. This thesis also delivers a characterisation of these networks, which serves two purposes – quantifying key elements of structure and behaviour; and using this information to build a foundation for subsequent industrial network analysis. The value of such an approach can be seen in the following example. With a detailed understanding of individual network characteristics, both separately and collectively, it is possible to determine the source of issues, the means available to address them, any barriers that might exist, and the consequences of implementing any strategic interventions. The analysis approach proposed in this thesis is based on multi-criteria decisions analysis (MCDA), which, as a process, combines initial problem structuring and subsequent quantitative analysis stages. The tools employed within MCDA have been employed variously around considerations of sustainable development. Their value in this thesis is their integration within a rigorous analytical framework. Rigorous problem structuring is attractive as it helps elucidate the complexities of the system and its environment and is, by definition, designed to deal with multiple environmental social and economic criteria that would have to be considered to promote sustainable development. For the quantitative analysis, the industrial network analysis draws from existing analysis tools in IE, but predominately from other systems research disciplines, such as process systems engineering (PSE) and supply chain management (SCM). These fields, due to their maturity and practical focus, have invested a lot of research into system design and strategic planning, capturing system dynamics and uncertainty to ensure, within selected system constraints, that a proposed system or changes to a system are viable, and that the system is capable of achieving the stated objectives. Both PSE and SCM rely heavily on optimisation for system design and planning, and achieve good results with it as an analytical tool. The similarity between industrial networks and process systems / supply chains, suggests that an optimisation platform, specifically multi-objective dynamic optimisation, could be employed fruitfully for the analysis of industrial networks. This is the approach taken in this thesis. It is consistent with the “top down” approach advocated previously, which is deemed preferable for the identification and implementation analysis of strategic interventions. This enables the determination of a structure (design) that is “best” able to operate under future conditions (planning) with respect to the chosen sustainable development objectives. However, an analysis is only ever as good as its underlying data and assumptions. The complexity and scope of the industrial network and the challenge of articulating sustainable development target(s) give rise to significant uncertainties. For this reason a framework is developed within this thesis that integrates uncertainty analysis into the overall approach, to obtain insight into the robustness of the analysis results. Quantifying all the uncertainties in an industrial network model can be a daunting task for a modeller, and a decision-maker can be confused by modelling results. Means are therefore suggested to reduce the set of uncertainties that have to be engaged with, by identifying those which impact critically on model outcomes. However, even if uncertainty cannot be reduced, and the implementation of any strategy retains a degree of risk, the uncertainty analysis has the benefit that it forces an analyst to engage in more detail with the network in question, and to be more critical of the underlying assumptions. The analysis approach is applied to two case studies in this thesis: one deals with waste avoidance in an existing wood-products network in a large urban metropolis; the other with the potential for renewable energy generation in a developing economy. Together, these case studies provide a rich tableau within which to demonstrate the full features of the industrial network analysis. These case studies highlight how the context within which the relevant industrial network functions influences greatly the evolution of the network over time; how uncertainty is managed; and what strategies are preferred in each case in order to enhance the contribution of each network to sustainable development. This thesis makes an intellectual contribution in the following areas: •      the characterisation of industrial networks to highlight sources of environmental issues, role the characteristics (could) play in the identification of (preferred) sustainable development strategies, and the need to explicitly consider these in a systems analysis. •     the synthesis, adaptation and application of existing tools to fulfil the need for analysis tools in IE that can handle both contextual and system complexity, and address the above mentioned issues of lacking consideration of o     system environment o    dynamic nature of the system and its environment o      economic and social impacts o   the effect of uncertainty on analysis outcomes. •       the development and demonstration of an industrial network analysis approach that o     is flexible enough to model any industrial network at the inter-firm level, regardless of form and configuration of materials and products circulated, and depending on the existing network and the proposed strategies. o     is able to encompass a wide range of environmental strategies, either individually or in combination depending on what best suits the situation, rather than focusing on any strategy in particular. o  ensures long term viability of strategies, rather than short term solutions delivering incremental improvement. •       the development of a comprehensive approach to capturing and assessing the effect of uncertainty on solution robustness for industrial network analysis, including the screening to determine the most important parameters, considering valuation and technical uncertainties, including future uncertainty. The industrial network analysis approach presented in this thesis looks more to how a network should develop (according to a set of sustainable development objectives), rather than how it may in actual fact develop. Consequently, the influence of agent interests and behaviour is not considered explicitly. This may be construed as a limitation of the industrial analysis approach. However, it is argued that the “top down” modelling approach favoured here is useful at a policy-making level. Here, for example, government instrumentalities, trade organisations and industry groupings, non-government organisations and community-based organisations are likely to be interested more in the performance of the network as a whole, rather than (necessarily) following the behaviour of individual agents within the network. Future work could well entertain the prospect of a mixed approach, in which the top-down approach of this thesis is complemented by a “bottom-up”, agent-based analysis. In this manner, it would be possible to give an indication of how attainable the identified industrial network development pathways are. Furthermore, the use of government incentives can be explored to assess if network development could appr"

Les comportements de mobilisation étaient évalués par les supérieurs et toutes les autres variables par les employés. Les analyses ont été réalisées sur un échantillon de 222 employés et 38 supérieurs de commerces au détail d’une chaîne canadienne. Nous avons établi les relations à l’aide de la méthode d’équations structurelles avec LISREL. Les résultats mettent en relief le rôle fondamental de la relation d’échange social entre les employés et leur supérieur, à travers la perception de support et de l’engagement affectif orientés vers ce dernier. This article presents the results of a study highlighting the role of perceived support and affective commitment in the relationship between the perception of three human resource management practices and two types of employee mobilization behaviours, as assessed by their supervisor. This study sought to explore the relationship between skills development practices, non-monetary recognition and information sharing, on the one hand, and mobilization behaviours in two categories or “areas” of performance, that is, behaviours related to work contract compliance and those related to high job performance, on the other. The concept of mobilization behaviours and its background will be presented in detail. This concept is part of a broader model, that of mobilizing human resources, which will also be presented. In light of research advances in this field, we measured two agents of support and commitment, that is, the supervisor and the organization .We chose management practices which are used in a discretionary manner by the organization but especially by supervisors. Indeed, deliberate intervention on the part of the supervisor increases the influence of these practices on the level of support perceived by employees. The social exchange and norm of reciprocity theories were used to explain the relationships between the different variables in our model. The social exchange theory helps to explain an employee’s decision as to whether or not to contribute to the well-being of the organization in response to the exchange relationships that he or she has experienced at work. Based on the postulate of reciprocity, it is understood that employees tend to show affective commitment to the organization and the supervisor, insofar as they also perceive that the latter are committed to them. More specifically, through positive initiatives such as the implementation of human resource management practices, the organization and the supervisor foster perceived support by getting across the symbolic message to employees that they are valued and taken into consideration. In response to this perceived support, employees develop affective commitment, that is, an emotional attachment to the organization and the supervisor. It is therefore postulated that employees who perceive support from the organization and the supervisor, through the implementation of discretionary human resource practices, will feel a moral obligation to repay these benefits, by demonstrating affective commitment and adopting mobilization behaviours. In this regard, it is recognized that mobilization is above all fostered by significant reciprocity relationships which are maintained through moral and social debts. We thus studied two social exchange relationships, that between the employee and the organization, and that between the employee and the supervisor. We also hypothesize that an employee’s commitment to the supervisor will lead him or her to display a greater number of mobilization behaviours related to work contract compliance, as these behaviours are likely to be particularly beneficial to the supervisor on a day-to-day basis. In order to eliminate common variance problems, we measured the employees’ mobilization behaviours (related to work contract compliance and high job performance) through a supervisor questionnaire, and the explanatory variables through an employee questionnaire. Analyses were carried out on a sample of 222 employees and 38 supervisors in a Canadian retail chain. Relationships were determined using structural equation modelling with LISREL. We also established the discriminant validity of the constructs by comparing various measurement models using LISREL. Lastly, alternative models were developed in order to assess the mediating effects of support from and commitment to the organization and the supervisor. Our results show that a favourable perception of skills development, non-monetary recognition and information sharing was positively linked to the perception of organizational support. Of these three practices, only information sharing was not associated with the perception of organizational support through the perception of support from the supervisor. Skills development and non-monetary recognition, on the other hand, positively influenced the perception of support from the supervisor which, in turn, reinforced the perception of organizational support. The relationships between the perception of organizational support, affective organizational commitment and high job performance behaviours, as assessed, were significant, as were the relationships between the perception of support from the supervisor, affective commitment to the supervisor and behaviours related to work contract compliance and high job performance, as assessed. Lastly, the link between affective commitment to the supervisor and behaviours related to work contract compliance, as assessed, was stronger than that between affective organizational commitment and these same behaviours, as assessed. Comparing alternative models to the structural model proposed made it possible to gather evidence regarding the mediating role of affective organizational commitment and affective commitment to the supervisor in the relationship between the perception of organizational support, the perception of support from the supervisor and mobilization behaviours. We set out to assess the explanatory power of perceived support and affective commitment involved in the relationship between employees, their supervisor and the organization. Our conclusions indicate that the relationship between employees and their supervisor in the retail trade industry is significant and should be taken into consideration by organizations that wish to foster the mobilization of employees through various human resource practices. Thus, we discovered that in response to the quality of their relationship with their supervisor, employees adopt a wide range of mobilization behaviours.

BeckJessicaMareile2008AHAt,,A Holistic Approach to Sustainability Analysis of Industrial Networks,"Beck, Jessica Mareile",2008,,,,,,,,,"The aim of this thesis is to support the evaluation of sustainable development strategies for industrial networks in the context of industrial ecology (IE). Industrial networks are a group of units which carry out, or contribute to, industrial activity, and are connected by material and energy flows, but also capital and information exchanges. The components of an industrial network encompass resource extraction, processing and refining, forming and assembly, use, disposal, as well as recycling and reprocessing. The motivation behind this research is the realisation that much of the current environmental system analysis focus within IE lacks a structured approach to considering: •   system environment •    dynamic nature of the system and its environment •      economic and social impacts •   the effect of uncertainty on analysis outcomes. It is argued in this thesis that current environmental analysis approaches used in IE can be improved in their capacity to capture the complexity of industrial systems, with the objective of promoting sustainable development. While IE emphasises the benefit of a systems approach to identifying environmental strategies in industry, analysis tools have to date not engaged extensively with important aspects such as the influence of system environment and dynamics on the viability of an environmental strategy, or with the economic or social impacts of industrial system development, which are equally important for sustainable development. Nor is the assessment of the effect of uncertainty on analysis outcomes an integral part of environmental analysis tools in IE. This is particularly significant when, in fact, the degree of uncertainty in assumptions and data used increases with the scope, and therefore the abstraction, of the system under consideration. IE will have to engage with the network and contextual complexities to a greater degree if it is to evolve from a concept to the application of its principles in practice. The main contribution of this thesis is therefore the development of a structured approach to analysing industrial networks for the purpose of identifying strategies to encourage sustainable development, while accounting for the complexity of the underlying system as well as the problem context. This analysis is intended to allow the identification of preferred network development pathways and to test the effectiveness of sustainable development strategies. A top-down, prescriptive approach is adopted for this purpose. This approach is chosen as the industrial network analysis is intended to identify how a network should develop, rather than focusing on how it could develop. Industrial networks are systems which are complex in both their structure and behaviour. This thesis also delivers a characterisation of these networks, which serves two purposes – quantifying key elements of structure and behaviour; and using this information to build a foundation for subsequent industrial network analysis. The value of such an approach can be seen in the following example. With a detailed understanding of individual network characteristics, both separately and collectively, it is possible to determine the source of issues, the means available to address them, any barriers that might exist, and the consequences of implementing any strategic interventions. The analysis approach proposed in this thesis is based on multi-criteria decisions analysis (MCDA), which, as a process, combines initial problem structuring and subsequent quantitative analysis stages. The tools employed within MCDA have been employed variously around considerations of sustainable development. Their value in this thesis is their integration within a rigorous analytical framework. Rigorous problem structuring is attractive as it helps elucidate the complexities of the system and its environment and is, by definition, designed to deal with multiple environmental social and economic criteria that would have to be considered to promote sustainable development. For the quantitative analysis, the industrial network analysis draws from existing analysis tools in IE, but predominately from other systems research disciplines, such as process systems engineering (PSE) and supply chain management (SCM). These fields, due to their maturity and practical focus, have invested a lot of research into system design and strategic planning, capturing system dynamics and uncertainty to ensure, within selected system constraints, that a proposed system or changes to a system are viable, and that the system is capable of achieving the stated objectives.

PichlerPegaretSchuerger1989Oppo,,Optimal pricing policies of a monopolistic market maker,"Pichler, Pegaret Schuerger",1989,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This thesis contributes to the understanding of price formation in financial markets by modelling the optimal price setting strategies of a risk neutral, monopolistic market maker. The market maker acts only as a dealer: buying and selling for his own account. Trades take place sequentially and the dealer sets prices so as to maximize expected return over time. Investors optimally choose the timing or the quantities of their trades. The main contribution of the thesis is its examination of the way in which the dealer optimally responds to information about investors' liquidity demands. Such information is especially important to dealers when there are temporary demand imbalances (more liquidity buying than selling, or vice versa). Knowledge of such imbalances allows a dealer to better interpret trade flow information about an asset's value and to increase expected return from liquidity trading. The dealer's response to liquidity demands is examined in two models. In the first, all agents share identical information (and identical beliefs) about the value of the traded asset. In the second model, the dealer faces the risk of trading with investors who have superior information. The dealer in both models prices above or below the mean value of the asset in order to take advantage of liquidity imbalances. In the symmetric information market this pricing strategy gives the dealer an expected realized spread (the spread earned across time) that is greater than the quoted spread. In the presence of informed traders, the dealer prices closer to the mean value in order to limit potential losses to information trading. In so doing, the dealer decreases the expected return from liquidity trading. As a result, the presence of inside traders in the market benefits the majority of liquidity traders, but the dealer may still benefit enough from liquidity imbalances to obtain a positive expected return, even when quoting a zero spread. Additional results include determinations of investors' effective reservation prices, based on their expectations of future trading opportunities, and numerical calculations that show how liquidity traders can be better off in markets with more traders."
DieckmannStephan2004Reri,,Rare event risk in a capital market equilibrium,"Dieckmann, Stephan",2004,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"My dissertation examines the question how rare event risk, in addition to small diffusive risk, is optimally shared among market participants in a capital market. In particular, within an equilibrium model I study how two natural sources of heterogeneity affect prices and allocations, heterogeneity in risk aversion and heterogeneity in beliefs. A rare event is assumed to be a jump in economic fundamentals, and a systematic source of uncertainty. In the second chapter, I focus on heterogeneity in risk aversion. I study a two-agent exchange economy, where agents can trade in a financial market consisting of a stock market, a money market, and an insurance market for rare event risk. In the framework of standard expected utility I find the surprising result that the less risk averse agent purchases insurance contracts against jump risk from the more risk averse agent. This equilibrium allocation is linked to the non-linear wealth sharing rule in such an economy. Since the benchmark economy with homogenous agents generates no excess uncertainty in the stock market, I study the effect on excess volatility and excess jump size solely due to different levels of relative risk aversion. I observe 3% excess uncertainty in jump sizes for a reasonable specification of economic fundamentals. In the third chapter, I focus on heterogeneity in beliefs about the frequency of rare events. Suppose the rare event is a negative jump leading to a market crash. The agent who anticipates less frequent jumps is willing to provide insurance against rare events for the agent anticipating a higher frequency. In the incomplete market where insurance is absent, the agent who anticipates less frequent jumps is optimally leveraging the portfolio. In this case, I find the surprising result that the equity premium of the stock market decreases. Under the assumption of logarithmic preferences, this is equivalent to an increasing interest rate. The result is linked to the non-linear risk sharing rule for rare event risk in the case of heterogeneity. Portfolio and price adjustments at the occurrence of a rare event can be very large. The model can be extended to capture the friction of heterogeneity in beliefs about the jump size, while agreeing on the frequency of rare events. I show a calibration of the model to catastrophe bonds linked to earthquake risk. The modeling part of my dissertation is based on three major concepts. First, I utilize a continuous-time pure exchange economy. The (exogenous) aggregate dividend process is assumed to follow a jump-diffusion process. Second, equilibria are characterized using martingale techniques. Third, I use a representative agent construction with stochastic weights to capture the effect of heterogeneous beliefs and possible incompleteness."
VoletiSudhir2009Ebef,,Estimating brand equity from aggregate data,"Voleti, Sudhir",2009,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Brands are now widely recognized as among a firm's most valuable assets. Hence the assessment of the value or equity of brand assets has attracted a lot of academic and practitioner attention in recent years. Various Brand Equity (henceforth, BE) measurement schemes have been proposed and utilized. These methods rely either on surveys or experimental approaches that require costly or complex data collection at the individual level, on valuation approaches requiring firm financial data, or on aggregate level product-market outcomes often utilizing fixed effects approaches that interpret brand intercepts as BE. In this dissertation, I propose and estimate a model of BE measurement based on a random effects approach that uses readily available data sources. In contrast to current methods based on aggregate data that model BE as a fixed unknown constant for each brand, I posit that realized BE values in any market are outcomes of a complex process that is difficult to specify completely, but which can be modeled as draws from an underlying distribution. The model is data-driven in that it does not explicitly specify how BE is generated from the underlying complex system. Rather, it makes identifying assumptions on the shape and domain of the unknown distribution based on the profit maximizing actions of rational economic agents. I develop the general conceptual framework for the model and adapt this framework to three different applications in the course of three essays: (1) Brand Equity as a Revenue Multiplier, an application based on a national dataset; (2) The Brand Equity of Private Labels, an application based on a multi-retailer dataset; and (3) Spatial Patterns in Brand Equity, based on a multi-market dataset. The random effects approach presents a simple, single-stage BE estimation and inference procedure that yields six distinct advantages: (i) an implicit baseline product for reference, (ii) easily interpretable results because BE is now a residual measure, (iii) useful downstream BE measures such as a BE dollar metric, which aids in assessing the financial value of brand assets, (iv) the use of a reduced form specification that does not make assumptions about the nature of the game and behavior of the players involved, (v) the incorporation of SKU based competitive effects modeled in product-attribute space, and all this (vi) in the presence of complex product structures and branding hierarchies. The tradeoff is that parametric assumptions on the underlying BE distribution need to be made. The first essay introduces the BE measurement problem, develops the modeling approach, tests the model empirically on national data in the beer category, and seeks to validate the analysis results using independent, external sources. I find that the results bear face and external validity, and parsimoniously account for inter-product competition. The second essay is an application of the proposed model to BE estimation of Private Labels in addition to those of National Brands. The conceptual model is adapted to a multi-retailer setting in which the Private Labels are all Store Brands, and response heterogeneity across retailers is incorporated using a random coefficients specification. I find that there is considerable heterogeneity in BE across brands and retailers, that some but not all Private Labels have BE and thereby are 'brands', and that Private Label BE estimates present evidence favoring an 'economic benefits and costs' value proposition. The third essay examines whether the demographic characteristics of U.S. metropolitan markets in conjunction with geospatial location information aid in understanding the level and distribution of BE across these markets. Unlike traditional spatial analyses that assume a multivariate normal error covariance structure, in this study I develop a distribution-free approach based on generalized least squares. I find heterogeneity in BE levels across brands and markets, substantial spatial correlation between the BEs of beer brands across geographic markets for many of the brands sampled, and a distinct regional pattern in the BE distribution. I find that the demographic composition of markets are related to the BE for many of the brands in the sample and further, that the parameter estimates of the demographic BE antecedents are substantially improved by the incorporation of spatial information into the model."

Agent-based modelling for evaluating the socioeconomic implications of land use interventions,"Serban, Anca",2018,,,,,,,Geography,,"The outcomes of research show that both the synergies and trade-offs which occur from economic, social and environmental objectives are important in defining sharing-sparing interventions that are locally feasible, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and that ultimately lead to better long-term conservation of biodiversity. The effectiveness of land sharing and land sparing (LS/LS) approaches to conservation in the face of rising agricultural demands has been widely debated. While numerous studies have investigated the LS/LS framework from an ecological lens (yield-biodiversity relationship) the relevance of the framework to real life depends on broader considerations. Some of the key caveats include: i) limited knowledge regarding the feasibility of interventions given diverse stakeholders’ interests, ii) the social acceptability (uptake) of these contrasting strategies to direct land users, and iii) limited knowledge regarding their impacts on individuals’ livelihoods and food security. Without considering these social science dimensions proponents of the framework risk an incomplete picture that is not grounded in local realities and can paradoxically force into opposition the very conservation and development interests they seek to reconcile. Using a Companion Modelling approach, which comprises the development of a role-playing game (RPG) and an agent-based model (ABM), this thesis addressed these caveats. The research was based in the Nilgiris of Western Ghats India, a tropical agricultural system at the forest frontier. The main findings show that through engaging local stakeholders in a participatory process, plausible land use strategies that align with their objectives could be identified. Stakeholders proposed three land use interventions. Two of them resemble a form of land sparing (‘monofunctional’ landscapes) on the farms: sparing land for Wildflower Meadows or Tree Plantations while increasing yield on the remaining land. The third intervention asks farmers to accept yield penalties for Intercropping more trees on their farms, a form of land sharing (‘integrated’ landscapes). In terms of decision-making regarding the adoption of these three interventions by direct land users, the study reveals several findings. Firstly there are three main types of motivations that influence farmers’ decision to adopt interventions, in order of importance: monetary benefits, pro-environmental motivations and social norms. Secondly, land use, the type of management preferred on the farm and whether land users accept trees on the farm or not are factors that influence what type of interventions is socially acceptable on individual farms. These factors have been detected in the in-depth household survey and also validated by the RPG. When assessing the adoption of the three interventions, ex ante their implementation, using an ABM, there are some important differences observed between the interventions. Wildflower Meadows is the intervention adopted by the largest number of households, whereas Intercropping is adopted across the largest area of land. Forest Plantations is significantly more unpopular than the other two interventions. The third line of investigation, about the outcomes of adoption, has important policy implications. Adding a socioeconomic dimension to the ecological one adds a level of complexity and creates a less straightforward choice between the LS/LS strategies. None of the three interventions can provide optimal outcomes for production, aspects of biodiversity conservation, livelihoods and food security. Each intervention has indicators that score better compared to the other two interventions. The findings demonstrate that the ecological focus of the LS/LS framework is insufficient to deal with real-world complexities and lends itself to overly simplistic policy prescriptions. More meaningful policies could be achieved when bridging natural and social sciences to better understand the merits and limitations of the LS/LS approaches. -Funds for Women Graduates (FfWG) -UNEP-WCMC -St Catharine’s College -Cambridge Philosophical Society -Janeta and Dorel Serban -British Ecological Society -Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"

In a general TMC scheme, a Central Authority Agency (CAA) issues a certain amount of mobility credits to eligible travelers. Credits are charged if the travelers take specific routes while the credits can also be traded in between of travelers in a market. An online interactive experiment, within which human participants extensively interact with each other and with intelligent virtual agents in credit trading and route choice stages, is conducted in this study. Hypothesized behavioral effects that characterize responses to TMC in personal car use domain, including loss aversion, immediacy effect and learning effect, are observed. Next, simulated experiments under various credit demand/supply situations, with only virtual agents, are conducted. The results show the proposed TMC scheme is fairly efficient and financially sustainable. Fast market equilibrium convergence is observed as well. The future TMC scheme design could accommodate the insights from this empirical study. In the meantime, the experiment platform could serve as a handy data collection tool that could be portable for any future studies involving online interactions and collective choices in transportation realm. •An online experiment is conducted to testify behavioral effects in tradable credit scheme.•Loss aversion is observed that losses loom larger than gains in tradable credit scheme.•Immediacy effect is observed that people overspend credits at the start of period.•Learning effect is observed that people adaptively adjust their bidding strategies.•The proposed tradable mobility credit scheme is fairly efficient and financially sustainable."

Consumers have to trade off among multiple product attributes before purchasing. Information technologies boost frequent interactions among consumers and lead their opinions to high mutability, which poses challenges for product suppliers. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the diffusion mechanism of emerging technologies in a highly competitive, complex, and dynamic environment, this paper builds an agent-based multi-dimensional relative agreement model and uses smartwatches as a concrete example to analyze their diffusion processes. Three numerical experiments are conducted, respectively focusing on: (1) characteristics of consumer groups; (2) new media marketing strategy; (3) initial expectation management. The results demonstrate: (1) high connectivity with low information uncertainty thresholds benefits product diffusion rate; (2) early promotion and moderate publicity are effective when new media is involved to promote new products; (3) the same initial expectation management strategy may give rise to different diffusion patterns; (4) highly inconsistent consumer opinions hinder product diffusion."

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been extended to incorporate technological progress, heterogeneity and uncertainty, making use of a (stochastic) dynamic equilibrium approach in order to derive a solution. According to the literature, the IAM class of models does not take all the relationships among economic, social and environmental factors into account. Moreover, it does not consider these interdependencies at the micro-level, meaning that all possible consequences are not duly examined. Here, we propose an agent-based approach to analyse the relationship between economic welfare and climate protection. In particular, our aim is to examine how the decisions of individual agents, allowing for the trade-off between economic welfare and climate protection, influence the aggregated emergent economic behaviour. Using this model, we estimate a damage function, with values in the order 3% - 4% for 2 degrees C temperature increase and having a linear (or slightly concave) shape. We show that the heterogeneity of the agents, technological progress and the damage function may lead to lower GDP growth rates and greater temperature-related damage than what is forecast by models with solely homogeneous (representative) agents."

As part of this debate, this paper investigates which factors lead to significant acceptance and sufficient growth of a CC from a bottom-up perspective, i.e., based on its members’ decisions. First, we identify the benefits and costs driving firms’ use of CCs and find four factors that constitute a trade-off: credit gains, reciprocity expectations, coordination costs, and intrinsic motivations. Second, we use an agent-based model to explore how these elements determine CCs’ success as a network. Our key finding is that the coupling of intrinsic motivation with preferential attachment – a phenomenon where members are more likely to transact with each other rather than with outsiders – may be the key to growth and acceptance: these results suggest that intrinsic motivation provides an incentive to join the network, but preferential attachment is the emerging economic rationale that drives firms’ acceptance of CCs. The identified trade-off and the theory of intrinsic motivation-preferential attachment provide new avenues to investigate under what conditions CCs contribute to resilient economies."

We find that there is a significant long-run cost in terms of both happiness and unemployment, which primarily affects the most vulnerable portion of the population. In addition, despite the expected instability in City's financial centre, the UK financial sector seems to be well equipped to deal with the repercussions, thus minimising the welfare costs for the country.

The design includes interactions between multiple buyers and sellers (household agents, developers, and rural land owners) and two local feedbacks to land value—price expectation formation based on local neighborhoods and spatial externalities. To address the methodological challenges inherent in the transition from equilibrium-based analytical models to agent-based simulation, we combine traditional deductive optimization models of behavior at the agent level with inductive models of price expectation formation. Relative to previous models, our proposed model is more closely linked to urban economics; contains a wider range of drivers of land use (LU); and addresses alternative models of division of gains from trade and determination of transaction prices, including models of bid and ask price formation. Our proposed approach is also closely linked to geographic cellular LU models, potentially uniting the strengths of these two disciplinary perspectives."

Although not the central focus of the review, we consider agent-based modeling of retail high streets against a backdrop of broader debate about downtown vitality and revitalization, amid a climate of economic challenges for brick-and-mortar retail. In particular, we consider how agent-based modeling, supported by insights from consideration of indoor shopping, can provide planning and decision support in outdoor high street settings. Our review considers abstractions of customers through conceptual modeling and customer typology, as well as abstractions of retailing as stationary and mobile. We examine high-level agency of shop choice and selection, as well as low-level agency centered on perception and cognition. Customer journeys are most often trips through geography; we therefore review path-planning, generation of foot traffic, wayfinding, steering, and locomotion. On busy high streets, journeys also manifest within crowd motifs; we thus review proximity, group dynamics, and sociality. Many customer journeys along retail high streets are dynamic, and customers will shift their journeys as they come into contact with experiences and service offerings. To address this, we specifically consider treatment of time and timing in agent-based models. We also examine sites for customer journeys, looking in particular at how agent-based models can provide support for the analysis of atmospherics, artifacts, and location-based services. Finally, we examine staff-side agency, considering store staff as potential agents outdoors; and we look at work to build agent-based models of fraud from customer journey analysis."

In his long career as a founding scholar of public choice, Gordon Tullock repeatedly followed the agent-oriented approach of methodological individualism. Many of Tullock's models are thus highly amenable to further exploration using that method.

By contrast, an optimization approach to management identifies the most efficient exploitation strategy by postulating an absolute understanding of the resource dynamics and its inherent uncertainties. Here, we study the potential and limitations of LBD in achieving optimal management by undertaking an analysis using a simple growth model as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of an agent equipped with a 'state-of-the-art' learning algorithm. The agent possesses no a priori knowledge about the resource dynamics, and learns management solely by resource interaction. We show that for a logistic growth function the agent can achieve 90% efficiency compared to the optimal control solution, whereas when a threshold (tipping point) is introduced, efficiency drops to 65%. Thus, our study supports the effectiveness of the LBD approach. However, when a threshold is introduced efficiency decreases as experimentation may cause resource collapse. Further, the study proposes that: an appropriate amount of experimentation, high valuation of future stocks (discounting) and, a modest rate of adapting to new knowledge, will likely enhance the effectiveness of LBD as a management strategy. •We study learning-by-doing when managing a renewable resource with non-linear dynamics.•We use a computational agent with learning and knowledge generation abilities.•The processes: learning, experimentation, hindsight and discounting are scrutinized.•A learning approach can reach 90% efficiency of optimal control management.•Learning-by-doing is costly when thresholds are present."

We describe a study in which we explored the efficiency of foraging strategies within a group of individuals faced with a resource-limited environment. We investigated to what extent cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors impacted on the survival rates of a population of individuals. In the experiment presented here, we considered two different types of individuals: selfish individuals who gather energy for their own use, and cooperative individuals who share the energy they gather with others, thus reducing their own individual chances of survival. In order to study the trade-off between non-cooperative and cooperative behaviors in a pseudo-realistic two-dimensional environment, we introduced an agent-based modeling and simulation tool called ACACIA-ES, which simulated local interactions and spatial behavior for large numbers of individuals in complex environments. The main result from our simulation was that a group of cooperative individuals displayed better survival strategies than groups of selfish individuals when faced with a variety of environmental pressures; however, it was very unlikely that such cooperative strategies could resist competition from selfish individuals, if the outcome of past social interactions was memorized, even when a very small group of selfish individuals was introduced."

A graph-based framework, namely Pregel, is used to carry out the rumor propagation simulation experiments. Through the experiments, the rationality of the Unite-Shad and the effectiveness of the GIS are verified.FindingsThe study discovers that the inconsistency between human behaviors and attitudes in rumor propagation can be explained by the Unite-shad model. Besides, the GIS, which shows better performance in small-world networks than in scale-free networks, can effectively suppress rumor propagation in the early stage.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper provides an effective immunization strategy for rumor governance.

However, increasing model sophistication and accuracyand therefore complexity-may trade-off with ease of use and applicability to real-world decision-making contexts, so it is vital to incorporate the lessons learned from implementation efforts into new model development. Using successful implementation efforts for guidance, we developed an integrated ES modelling system to quantify several ecosystem services: forest timber production and carbon storage, water purification, pollination, and biodiversity. The system is designed to facilitate uptake of ES information into land-use decisions through three principal considerations: (1) using relatively straightforward models that can be readily deployed and interpreted without specialized expertise; (2) using an agent-based modelling framework to enable the incorporation of human decision-making directly within the model; and (3) integration among all ES models to simultaneously demonstrate the effects of a single land-use decision on multiple ES. We present an implementation of the model for a major watershed in Alberta, Canada, and highlight the system's capabilities to assess a suite of ES under future management decisions, including forestry activities under two alternative timber harvest strategies, and through a scenario modelling analysis exploring different intensities of hypothetical agricultural expansion. By using a modular approach, the modelling system can be readily expanded to evaluate additional ecosystem services or management questions of interest in order to guide land-use decisions to achieve socioeconomic and environmental objectives."

An observed population of farms is modelled as a multi-agent system where individual farm-agent behaviour and their interactions—principally competition for land—are defined through an optimization framework with land use and landscape impacts resulting as emergent properties of the system. The model is calibrated to real data on the farms and the landscape to be studied. We illustrate the utility of the model by evaluating the potential impacts of three alternative frameworks for the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on landscape values in two marginal agricultural regions. Mosaic value was found to be sensitive to the choice of policy scheme in one of the landscapes, whereas significant trade-offs were shown to occur in terms of species richness by habitat and species composition at the landscape scale in both regions. The relationship between food production and other ecosystem services was found to be multifaceted. Thus illustrating the difficulty of achieving landscape goals in a particular region with simple or general land management rules (such as the current rules attached to CAPs direct payments). Given the scarcity of funding for conservation, the level and conditions for allocating direct payments are, potentially, of great importance for preserving landscape values in marginal agricultural regions (subject to levels of other support)."

Traditional diffusion models have aimed at empirical generalizations and hence describe the spread of new products parsimoniously at the market level. More recently, agent-based modeling and simulation has increasingly been adopted since it operates on the individual level and, thus, can capture complex emergent phenomena highly relevant in diffusion research. Agent-based methods have been applied in this context both as intuition aids that facilitate theory-building and as tools to analyze real-world scenarios, support management decisions and obtain policy recommendations. This review addresses both streams of research. We critically examine the strengths and limitations of agent-based modeling in the context of innovation diffusion, discuss new insights agent-based models have provided, and outline promising opportunities for future research. The target audience of the paper includes both researchers in marketing interested in new findings from the agent-based modeling literature and researchers who intend to implement agent-based models for their own research endeavors. Accordingly, we also cover pivotal modeling aspects in depth (concerning, e.g., consumer adoption behavior and social influence) and outline existing models in sufficient detail to provide a proper entry point for researchers new to the field."

Furthermore, the agent-based model benefits from Association Rule Mining to define farmer agents’ agricultural decision-making in various conditions. The processes within the WEF nexus are simultaneously physical, socio-economic, ecological, and political. Indeed, there are interrelated interactions among the mentioned processes in ways that have not yet been properly delineated and mapped.

Different cost reduction scenarios were introduced for investigating the PC policy effectiveness. The proposed model and simulation approach can be used for other cities and generalized to the whole Chinese PC industry with the potential to include more local policies and corresponding data.FindingsSimulation results show that carbon emission reduction will be between 60,000 and 80,000 tons with policy incentives, nearly double that of the no policy intervention scenario. The target of 30% PC in all new buildings by 2026 in China is achievable with the subsidy policies of linear cost reduction, or cost reduction conforms to the learning curve.Practical implicationsSimulation results of three kinds of policy show that subsidy policy optimization is necessary regarding reducing the level of subsidy needed. The carbon credit policy is not essential since it has little influence on PC development. Implementing the project procurement restriction policy is not recommended if the scale of development of PC is more important than achieving the development target.Originality/valueThis study can help the government and developers make better policy and strategic decisions on PC development and boost the sustainability transition of the construction industry."

It extends the existing modelling efforts by considering contract constraints in short-term gas sales and explicitly simulating trade in two types of spot markets. The study also contributes to the methodologies of stranded asset analysis by taking into account two aspects which are commonly overlooked: market fluctuation subject to the changing export capacities and the impacts of market signals on investor decision making. The results of the base scenario indicate that if gas demand follows current policy expectations, the scale of asset stranding is likely to be limited. This is attributed to supply capacity shortage of medium-sized exporters due to a slowing of their investment. Moreover, two alternative scenarios show that, when the markets face sudden reduction in demand, they leverage the flexibilities in their long-term contracts and opt more gas through spot trade. Though the issue of stranding is not significant globally in these scenarios, exporting regions with high short-run delivery costs, especially North America and Australia, have higher risks of asset stranding as they are arguably less competitive in spot sales. •Gas-GAME-Spot simulates gas export asset stranding with an agent-based framework.•Global stranding is limited due to reduced investment by medium-sized exporters.•Markets can alleviate asset stranding by reflecting declined demand in contracting.•Contract-based trade bounds the stranding risk if future demand decreases abruptly.•Export regions with higher short-run costs face more risks of stranding."
AlexandrovskyDaniela2021EBAI,,Early Bronze Age I Tabular Scraper Distribution: an Agent-Based Modeling Approach,"Alexandrovsky, Daniela and אלכסנדרובסקי, דניאלה",2021,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The Early Bronze Age witnessed the rise of urban centers in the southern Levant. During this period, notable changes in various realms, including architecture, technology and socioeconomic organization have occurred: the appearance of fortified cities, the use of metals and the new phenomenon of regionalism in the southern Levantine sphere were part and parcel of new socio-economic developments. From the early stages of the Early Bronze Age exhibiting vague, fluctuating levels of administrative social organization, to the prominent urban centers characterizing the final stage of this period, the Early Bronze Age represents a timespan riddled with complex social and political processes.A key aspect of the social developments witnessed throughout the Early Bronze Age were the relationships formed between village communities and pastoral nomadic communities, specifically in the realm of trade. A distinct identifier of this trade is the tabular scraper, a flint tool found in small numbers among some Early Bronze Age villages and other types of settlements. With its sources spread out primarily across the deserts of Jordan, the tabular scraper was proposed by scholars to have been an integral component of south Levantine pastoral nomadic economic subsistence strategies, as it was traded with village communities away from the arid fringes. However, the exchange system or strategy through which this tool was circulated remains elusive.In order to explore the distribution pattern and the nature of tabular scraper trade during this period, both among villages themselves and between villages and pastoral nomads, an agentbased model simulating trade interactions was constructed. The model serves as a computational experiment in which 21 southern Levantine sites are included, testing a hypothesis pertaining to a pastoral nomadic presence in the southern Levant and its effect on tabular scraper trade during the Early Bronze Age I. Two additional hypotheses regarding socio-economic organization during this period are also included in this model. This experimentation is done comparatively to the currently available data regarding tabular scraper distribution from the 21 sites that are a part of this research. In the experiment, the hypothesis regarding the involvement of pastoral nomadic communities in the production and distribution of tabular scrapers is expressed through the mobility of these communities: different mobility patterns were tested to deduce possible correlations with the distribution of tabular scrapers among the 21 selected sites. Of the hypotheses regarding socio-economic organization during the Early Bronze Age I tested in this experiment – the first suggests larger settlements trade a smaller percentage of their tools in comparison to smaller settlements (mimicking a dynamic consumption/exchange rate of tools), while the second suggests both large and small settlements trade the same percentage of tools (mimicking a fixed consumption/exchange rate). Both hypotheses are based on a theoretical framework of ancient trade and on substantivism in particular, which suggests ancient trade was conducted both to obtain materialistic goals (‘profit’) and to create/maintain relationships.The agent-based model presented in this thesis demonstrates how different mobility patterns employed by pastoral nomadic communities affect the distribution pattern of tabular scrapers: when pastoral nomads are active both in the Negev area and in other regions northwards, a tool distribution pattern which is similar to that of the archaeological record is observed. Additionally, and in conjunction with pastoral nomadic mobility patterns, this model shows how a dynamic consumption/exchange rate of tabular scrapers among settlements aids in explaining the currently known distribution of these tools throughout the southern Levant. It explores the diverse trajectories through which tabular scraper trade may have been employed and the tools’ distribution patterns under different social conditions, aligning with the archaeological record. The results obtained from the agent-based model serve to explain how VI different social systems in which pastoral nomadic communities were involved, circulated tabular scrapers in the region.

Technical, cybersecurity, renewable energy integration, economic, pricing mechanisms, and regulatory challenges are among the key obstacles that may curtail the full potential of P2P energy trading. In addition, the full achievement of the P2P energy trading potential requires a global response from stakeholders to ensure widespread acceptance and adoption. Game theory and agent-based modeling can effectively address these challenges and facilitate the successful implementation of P2P energy trading."

Hidalgo et al.

A recent stream of research suggests that this product space can be used as an instrument to guide public policy. To assess the potential effects of these policies on an economy's export performance, and on the ones of its competitors, we build a micro-founded simulation model of the evolution of countries’ positions on the product space. We find that export subsidies and polices aiming at improving firm's innovation capabilities can be effective tools for increasing a country’ export performance; however, this increase occurs at the expense of competing countries, as they support unpredictable changes in the variety of their exports."

However, using organic waste as fertilizer can also induce unintended pollution. These combined impacts can be understood through the perspective of a social-ecological system and studied using an integrated assessment and modeling approach. Presently, no tool completely enables stakeholders to grasp the multiple tradeoffs and synergies among biomass-management strategies while considering the unique characteristics and heterogeneity of their region. This article introduces MAELIA-OWM, an integrated assessment and modeling platform that aims to fill this gap. To illustrate the platform's abilities, MAELIA-OWM was applied to the Versailles Plain, France. Two scenarios of organic waste recycling with increased use of organic waste were compared to a baseline mineral fertilization scenario using a set of agro-environmental and socioeconomic indicators. The results predicted that increasing organic fertilization in the Versailles Plain would increase fertilization costs and workload, slightly increase nitrogen losses but improve soil quality through soil carbon storage. Results also highlighted that impacts of intensive organic fertilization on the overall greenhouse gas balance depends on the methods used to allocate greenhouse gas emissions between producers and/or users of organic waste. When shared on a 50-50 basis between upstream activities and downstream agricultural production, greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent across all three scenarios. The “potential mineral and organic practices” scenario improves soil quality but increases production costs and nitrate leaching risks. Therefore, based on these simulations, increasing organic fertilization can be considered as a step forward into the agroecological transition but requires careful use by and compensation for farmers.

In this paper, we developed a spatial agent-based model (ABM) that simulates the adoption of home-based rainwater harvesting (RWH) and greywater recycling (GWR) by single-family households in Boston, United States. We applied system dynamics modeling (SDM) to evaluate the impacts of decentralized technologies on the UWS. The change in carbon emissions of the UWS was modeled as the environmental benefit for household choice decisions in ABM. We validated our integration by comparing the simulated reservoir elevations with the reference-year values and comparing where early adoptions emerge with the reported installations. In the results, we first examined the sensitivity of the adoption and diffusion to the market promotion, neighbor's influence, environmental benefits, and economic attractiveness. Our simulation highlights the diffusion from central downtown to the suburban. RWH has higher adoptions than GWR, and RWH starts diffusing much earlier. Reservoir water availability is improved through the adoption of RWH and GWR. As the tradeoffs, reservoirs discharge more water for storage security, and hydropower generation becomes less as the need of water transfer decreases. The UWS do not reduce carbon emissions due to the high electricity consumption of GWR. Utilizing the improved water resources and reducing the impact of decentralized technologies are required for sustainable promotion of water decentralization. Our integrated modeling can be improved by including more critical socio-technical interactions for spatial planning of decentralized water technologies. •A framework for planning water at the nexus of human-infrastructure-environment.•Agent-based model to simulate spatial adoption of decentralized water technologies.•System dynamics model to quantify the impact of adoption on water system.•Rainwater harvesting has a higher potential among Boston single-family communities.•Suggestions are identified for sustainable promotion of decentralization."

For this purpose, a case study on the compliance of pig farmers with antibiotics legislation in the Netherlands was used. Findings – The effect of social factors (acceptance of legislation and social influence) on compliance levels was tested as well as the number of inspectors. This showed that the model can help to choose the most optimal intervention strategy depending on the input parameters. Research limitations/implications – Further expansion of the model may be necessary, e.g. including economic factors, in order to reflect real-life situations more closely. Practical implications – The model can be used by inspection services to effectively implement their control programme.

Specifically, this research studies the participation decisions of both senders and carriers over time and the impacts of the resulting feedback loop on platform growth and performance.Design/methodology/approachAn agent-based model is developed and used to study dynamic behavior and network effects within a simulated crowd-shipping platform. The model allows both carriers and senders to be represented as autonomous, heterogeneous and adaptive agents, whose decisions to participate in the platform impact the participation of other agents over time. Survey data inform the logic governing agent decisions and behaviors.FindingsThe feedback loop created by individual sender and carrier agents' participation decisions generates complex and dynamic network effects that are observable at the platform level. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of having sufficient crowd carriers available when the platform is initially launched, as well as ensuring that sender and carrier participation remains balanced as the platform grows over time.Research limitations/implicationsThe model successfully demonstrates the power of agent-based modeling (ABM) in analyzing network effects in crowd-shipping systems. However, the model has not yet been fully validated with data from a real-world crowd-shipping platform. Furthermore, the model's geographic scope is limited to a single census tract. Platform behavior will likely differ across geographic regions, with varying demographics and sender/carrier density.Practical implicationsThe modeling approach can be used to provide the manager of a volunteer-based crowd-shipping program for food rescue with insights on how to achieve a critical mass of participants, with an appropriate balance between the number of restaurant food donation delivery requests and the number of crowd-shippers available and willing to make those deliveries.Social implicationsThis research can help a crowd-shipping platform for urban food rescue to grow and become self-sustainable, thereby serving more food-insecure people.Originality/valueThe model represents both senders and the carrier crowd as autonomous, heterogeneous and adaptive agents, such that network effects resulting from their interactions can emerge and be observed over time. The model was designed to study a volunteer crowd-shipping platform for food rescue, with participant motivations driven by personal values and social factors, rather than monetary incentives."

This study adopts agent-based modeling to interpret the impact of taxation and subsidies on social distribution. The classic simple economy model created by Wilensky is expanded. Moreover, in order to apply the model to the field of social distribution better, a simple tax subsidy model and a progressive tax model are created. After comparison and analysis, we find that when there is a serious gap between the rich and the poor in society, simple tax subsidy policy and progressive taxation policy are both beneficial to improve social wealth distribution, as expected, progressive taxation policy becomes more effective. This study can be a supplement to the traditional empirical analysis on wealth distribution. It also fully reflects the effectiveness of tax subsidy policy, especially progressive tax policy. Our research has certain guiding significance for policy makers. The government should make full use of taxation and subsidies to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. It is necessary to actively improve the tax system and adopt appropriate tax standards, which helps to achieve the best trade-off between improving social equity and improving economic efficiency."
GoodingTim2019EfaF,,Economics for a Fairer Society: Going Back to Basics using Agent-Based Models,"Gooding, Tim",2019,,,,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,"This Palgrave Pivot presents experiments that reveal core dynamics of trade in a complex system. Monetary trade is stripped of all its complications and placed in agent-based models, a complexity research tool capable of reproducing emergent behaviour and evolution. Included are ground-breaking repeatable experiments exploring the impact of evolutionary prerequisites empirically present in markets. Isolating the core dynamics of trade results in very simple agent-based models. However, decades of complexity research demonstrate that even the simplest systems result in emergent behaviour that is extremely difficult to anticipate. Readers who are only familiar with the linear-system theories and models used to train almost all undergraduate economics students might be surprised to witness price detaching from supply and demand, and extreme poverty and wealth arising in trade systems populated by agents with equal ability and opportunity. Watch as empirical evolutionary prerequisites are introduced and price patterns characterising two different markets – asset markets and speculative markets – emerge irrespective of supply and demand. In addition to laying the groundwork of monetary trade in a complex system, more complicated models feature mortal reproductive agents. Including 'living' populations in economic models reveal how the complexity characteristics of our market economy are impacting impoverishment and starvation. This book invites anyone interested in economics to join the growing ranks of people who are fascinated by the insights offered by complexity research."

John and Salari, Mostafa",2020,Symmetry (Basel),12,7,1087-,,,Mdpi,BASEL,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has imposed the need for a series of social distancing restrictions worldwide to mitigate the scourge of the COVID-19 pandemic. This applies to many domains, including airplane boarding and seat assignments. As airlines are considering their passengers' safety during the pandemic, boarding methods should be evaluated both in terms of social distancing norms and the resulting efficiency for the airlines. The present paper analyzes the impact of a series of restrictions that have been imposed or mooted worldwide on the boarding methods used by the airlines, featuring the use of jet-bridges and one-door boarding. To compare the efficacy of classical airplane boarding methods with respect to new social distancing norms, five metrics were used to evaluate their performance. One metric is the time to complete the boarding of the airplane. The other four metrics concern passenger health and reflect the potential exposure to the virus from other passengers through the air and surfaces (e.g., headrests and luggage) touched by passengers. We use the simulation platform in NetLogo to test six common boarding methods under various conditions. The back-to-front by row boarding method results in the longest time to complete boarding but has the advantage of providing the lowest health risk for two metrics. Those two metrics are based on passengers potentially infecting those passengers previously seated in the rows they traverse. Interestingly, those two risks are reduced for most boarding methods when the social distance between adjacent passengers advancing down the aisle is increased, thus indicating an unanticipated benefit stemming from this form of social distancing. The modified reverse pyramid by half zone method provides the shortest time to the completing boarding of the airplane and-along with the WilMA boarding method-provides the lowest health risk stemming from potential infection resulting from seat interferences. Airlines have the difficult task of making tradeoffs between economic productivity and the resulting impact on various health risks."

This study aims to build an agent-based model to understand the risk of land degradation and famine in North Korea and explore potential solutions to mitigate this risk. The model concept reflects the general information of collective farms in North Korea, which was set in 1960, and the abstract of the social-ecological system of North Korean agriculture. The model comprises the agent, environment, and external factors. An agent is defined as a household that decides its labor allocation and land use by how much food it has. The environment is set to multiple layers that represent the soil environment of the farm, affected by agents' decisions. The external factors reflect a land-use restriction policy, international trade (food aid), and climate change. We calibrated the model using data from North Korea and simulated various scenarios. Our findings suggest that the famine in the model would occur around 35 years later, almost reflecting the 1995 famine in the real world. The scenario-based simulations show that additional food aid or import could delay the famine, but fundamental solutions are needed to break the vicious circle of land degradation and declining food yield. Our study provides insights into the complex adaptive system of North Korean agriculture and the critical points of famine risk. Our agent-based model can be a useful tool for policymakers and researchers to explore potential solutions and inform risk management strategies."

Using data from Wolong Nature Reserve for the conservation of the world-famous giant pandas in China, we employ a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate how family-planning and other fertility-related decisions may affect human population, household number, and panda habitat over time. Simulation results indicate that (1) population size has the shortest time lag in response to changes in family-planning decisions, and panda habitat has the longest time lag; (2) the amount of panda habitat is more sensitive to factors affecting number of households than those affecting population size; (3) although not large in quantity nor changing landscape fragmentation substantially, the associated changes in habitat are in good areas for the panda. This study offers a novel approach to studying long-term demographic and environmental effects of family-planning and fertility-related decisions across space."

Lessons from Artificial Markets,"Veryzhenko, Iryna and Arena, Lise and Harb, Etienne and Oriol, Nathalie",2017,"Intelligent systems in accounting, finance & management",24,3-Feb,73-79,,,Wiley,CHICHESTER,"Summary In this paper, we focus on the French cancel order tax implemented on 1 August 2012. We question the effectiveness of the modified tax with no exemptions and we analyze its impact on market quality, measured by liquidity, volatility and efficiency. Additionally, this paper raises the question whether this tax leads to a reduction of high‐frequency trading (HFT) activities and a decline in trading volume. Based on our findings we report that introduction of cancel order tax only slightly reduces HFT activities, but it significantly affects market liquidity, increases market volatility and leads to deteriorating market efficiency. We conclude that it is difficult to dissuade investors from entering into unproductive trades and eliminate negative outputs of HFT (such as price manipulations) through tax, without altering the benefits of HFT like liquidity provision and efficient price discovery."

While these contributions are important, methodological limitations have prevented theoretical considerations of the emergence and evolution of marketplaces and market exchange in prehistory. We propose that agent-based modeling provides a window to explore physical conditions and agent behaviors that facilitate the emergence of customary exchange locations and how such locations may evolve into socially embedded institutions. The model we designed suggests that simple bartering rules among agents can generate concentrated locations of exchange and that spatial heterogeneity of resources is the most important factor in facilitating the emergence of such locales. Furthermore, partner-search behaviors and exchange of information play a key role in the institutionalization of the marketplace. The results of our simulation suggest that marketplaces can develop, even with the absence of formalized currency or central planning, as a consequence of collective strategies taken up by agents to reduce exchange partner-search costs and make transactions more frequent and predictable. The model also suggests that, once established as a social institution, marketplaces may become highly conservative and resistant to change. As such, it is inferred that bottom-up and/or top-down interventions may have often been required to establish new marketplaces or relocate marketplaces to incorporate new resources, resolve supply-demand imbalances, or minimize rising economic costs that arise as a result of social, political, and economic change."

Firstly, study of economic systems is traditionally based on analytical and econometric tools, which have been the main arbiters of the veracity or plausibility of assumptions and hypotheses in economics. This approach has been proved to be highly suitable for theory development. Secondly, practical issues and necessity to support decision-making led to development of various modelling and simulation techniques or tools. However; majority of these approaches usually fail when coping with complexity. Furthermore, several main areas of interest can be identified in the business and economics modelling. Nevertheless, these areas are mostly independent due to their problem-based focusing on particular issues and their solutions. Depicted gaps might be bridged with the help of new modelling paradigms that have been established only recently. Application of agent-based modelling in the realm of economic systems is labelled as Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE). In particular sections of this paper results of experiments run on the novel model are described. The model is based on agents, which are described as a vector of several observed parameters, and four types of agents are used, namely consumer agent, factory agent, mining agent, and transportation agent. In addition, a colony is added as the fifth type of meta-agent. Scalability and configuration options of the model enable for various configuration and thus for conducting specific experiments. The presented system is already implemented as a prototype version in the NetLogo environment. The paper depicts two example scenarios, resource production and resource proximity, and offers interpretation of achieved results. Since most of the work done so far was focused on individual agents, group perspective as an important extension of ACE modelling is suggested as the further research and development direction."

Specifically, this study evaluates how management agents behave in the presence of variable timber prices, harvesting costs, and accessibility to timber and how their actions influence the spatial characteristics of the forest landscape over time. The GIS calculates the average harvested patch size, number of patches, and total harvested area as measures of emergent patterns resulting from agent actions. The results from the agent-based GIS model reveal that good economic conditions lead to few but large harvested patches, while deteriorating conditions will see more patches of smaller size if forest companies have access to high-quality timber. This study emphasizes the need for a complex systems approach to forest management as the model illustrates how system elements interact in a manner to produce emergent spatial patterns over time."

Design/methodology/approach This study uses an agent-based model to simulate risk assessments in risk workshops. Combining the notions of transactive memory and the ideal speech situation, this study establishes a risk assessment benchmark and then investigates real-world deviations from this benchmark. Specifically, this study models limits to information transfer, incomplete discussions and potentially detrimental group characteristics, as well as interaction patterns. Findings First, limits to information transfer among workshop participants can prevent a correct consensus. Second, increasing the required number of stable discussion rounds before an assessment improves the correct assessment of high but not low likelihood risks. Third, while theoretically advantageous group characteristics are associated with the highest assessment correctness for all risks, theoretically detrimental group characteristics are associated with the highest assessment correctness for high likelihood risks. Fourth, prioritizing participants who are particularly concerned about the risk leads to the highest level of correctness. Originality/value This study shows that by increasing the duration of simulated risk workshops, the assessments change – as a rule – from underestimating to overestimating risks, unraveling a trade-off for risk workshop facilitators. Methodologically, this approach overcomes limitations of prior research, specifically the lack of an assessment and process benchmark, the inability to disentangle multiple effects and the difficulty of capturing individual cognitive processes."

For each of these topics, relevant models, methods and tools are identified and scrutinized. Findings Behavioral economics and finance establish an effective bridge between orthodox economic thinking and new and revolutionary methods of analysis. Exploring the intricacies of human behavior can frequently be done by adapting the trivial and conventional intertemporal utility maximization models that economists insistently resort to, but to fully grasp such intricacies, a step forward is required. Agent-based models and other tools from complexity sciences constitute the analytical arsenal that is needed to improve our understanding of how behavioral issues attach to heterogeneity, local interaction, path-dependence, out-of-equilibrium dynamics and emergence. Originality/value Although surveys on behavioral economics and finance abound in the specialized literature, this study has the peculiarity of emphasizing five relevant topics that are particularly illustrative of the pivotal role of behavioral science in promoting the transition from the strict neoclassical perspective to a less mechanic and more organic view of economics and finance."

The use of agent based simulators encourages good software engineering design such as separation of concerns, that is, the uncoupling of the model description from its implementation detail. A major limitation in current approaches to ABM simulation is that of the trade off between simulator flexibility and performance. It is common that highly optimised simulations, such as those which target graphics processing units (GPU) hardware, are implemented as standalone software. This work presents a software framework (FLAME GPU 2) which balances flexibility with performance for general purpose ABM. Methods for ensuring high computational efficacy are demonstrated by, minimising data movement, and ensuring high device utilisation by exploiting opportunities for concurrent code execution within a model and through the use of ensembles of simulations. A novel hierarchical sub‐modelling approach is also presented which can be used to model certain types of recursive behaviours. This feature is shown to be essential in providing a mechanism to resolve competition for resources between agents within a parallel environment which would otherwise introduce race conditions. To understand the performance characteristics of the software, a benchmark model with millions of agents is used to explore the use of simulation ensembles and to parametrically investigate concurrent code execution within a model. Performance speedups are demonstrated of 3.5×$$ \times $$ and 10×$$ \times $$ respectively over a baseline GPU implementation. Our hierarchical sub‐modelling approach is used to demonstrate the implementation of a recursive algorithm to resolve competition of agent movement which occurs as a result of agent desire to simultaneously occupy discrete areas high in a ‘resource’. The algorithm is used to implement a classical socio‐economics model, Sugarscape, with populations of up to 16M agents."

Because, typically, there is not an integrated or centralized institution coordinating transactions in IWMs, social networks and communications between farmers play a key role. This makes applications of ABMs in the informal space appealing and useful. Survey and interview data are used for the model development via a sample of farmers in Mojen Area, Iran. Also, in the final model, some critical human behaviors (e.g. adaptability and self-interest) are described in the form of parameters and formulas, with optimum values calibrated based on the Mojen sample as well as making possible a detailed assessment of the effects on water transaction and farmers’ profit margins. The result of the simulation reveals that IWM trade frees up water for use by other farmers in the Mojen area, especially when stronger social networks are in place where the average number of water transactions will be increased—about 50%. The presence of IWMs also contributes to a more stable cultivation area in dry years, where water trading helps protect perennial crops that have become an increased production system choice in recent years. Further, informal water markets help farmers to optimally use water supply in order to deal with lower rainfall years and fulfil water needs during higher rainfall years due to increasing cultivation areas. [Display omitted] •An agent-based social network model for informal water market (IWM) simulation is developed.•A method of trades and an updating rule for simulating profit margins are proposed.•Experience, prior knowledge, and land area are three factors affecting water exchanges.•IWM can greatly improve the situation of water scarcity.•IWM stimulates farmers to use water in the best way in both trading and irrigation."

This paper presents a novel architecture of electricity agents in smart grid markets. The architecture implements a middleware that allows standard agent plug-ins representing “smart grid” elements in a two-way power flow. Agent operations are automated to allow demand variations and exploring a wider spectrum of trade opportunities in an efficient manner, while coordinating with the system operator for reliability, security, and stability. We give trade and operation computational models of power grid components and their interaction protocols and authentication in a multi-agent framework. Trade models are both pool and multilateral based. Operation models respect power dispatch limits, generation and transmission constraints, and spinning reserve requirements. The models are coded as part of the agent software. The protocols are KQML (Knowledge Query Manipulation Language) based communication. An IEEE 5-bus grid system is used for illustration. The testing results for different load profiles show better distribution of market sales and a market clearing price convergence very close to the marginal cost of generation supply, thus an implication of economic efficiency of energy resources, as well as security and power quality compared to traditional electricity trade models based on Cournot and Bertrand estimated clearing prices."

In this paper, we present a high fidelity multi-agent simulation model called A-RESCUE (Agent-based Regional Evacuation Simulator Coupled with User Enriched behavior) that integrates the rich activity behavior of the evacuating households with the network level assignment to predict and evaluate evacuation clearance times. The simulator can generate evacuation demand on the fly, truly capturing the dynamic nature of a hurricane evacuation. The simulator consists of two major components: household decision-making module and traffic flow module. In the simulation, each household is an agent making various evacuation related decisions based on advanced behavioral models. From household decisions, a number of vehicles are generated and entered in the evacuation transportation network at different time intervals. An adaptive routing strategy that can achieve efficient network-wide traffic measurements is proposed. Computational results are presented based on simulations over the Miami-Dade network with detailed representation of the road network geometry. The simulation results demonstrate the evolution of traffic congestion as a function of the household decision-making, the variance of the congestion across different areas relative to the storm path and the most congested O-D pairs in the network. The simulation tool can be used as a planning tool to make decisions related to how traffic information should be communicated and in the design of traffic management policies such as contra-flow strategies during evacuations."

We construct an agent-based version of Hotelling’s two-stage game of spatial competition and explore the possibilities of creating synergies between the two approaches. Game theoretic insights into strategic behavior and equilibrium states can provide useful theoretic underpinnings for agent-based approaches in regional science. By combining the two, we can model micro-based social order as it emerges out of local interactions. The use of agent-based modelling in the context of a multistage game is new and hence provides a valuable contribution to both streams of the literature. We show that combining the two approaches is feasible, also in the context of a more complex two-stage game. The model correctly reproduces the analytical results and also allows for more complex situations. As an example, we show the effect of different levels of consumer tastes for variety in Main Street. The reconstruction of Hotelling’s model of spatial competition opens up a wide variety of possibilities for further extensions that can lead to a better understanding of the variations we observe in reality. For some extensions, the use of a single-stage model would probably be more feasible though."
LemppFrieder2020Anas,,A new agent-based simulation model of bilateral negotiation,"Lempp, Frieder",2020,The International journal of conflict management,31,1,115-148,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new agent-based simulation model of bilateral negotiation based on a synthesis of established theories and empirical studies of negotiation research. The central units of the model are negotiators who pursue goals, have attributes (trust, assertiveness, cooperativeness, creativity, time, etc.) and perform actions (proposing and accepting offers, exchanging information, creating value, etc). Design/methodology/approach Methodologically, the model follows the agent-based approach to modeling. This approach is chosen because negotiations can be described as complex, non-linear systems involving autonomous agents (i.e. the negotiators), who interact with each other, pursue goals and perform actions aimed at achieving their goals. Findings This paper illustrates how the model can simulate experiments involving variables such as negotiation strategy, creativity, reservation value or time in negotiation. An example simulation is presented which investigates the main and interaction effects of negotiators’ reservation value and their time available for a negotiation. A software implementation of the model is freely accessible at https://tinyurl.com/y7oj6jo8. Research limitations/implications The model, as developed at this point, provides the basis for future research projects. One project could address the representation of emotions and their impact on the process and outcome of negotiations. Another project could extend the model by allowing negotiators to convey false information (i.e. to bluff). Yet another project could be aimed at refining the routines used for making and accepting offers with a view to allow parties to reach partial settlements during a negotiation. Practical implications Due to its broad scope and wide applicability, the model can be used by practitioners and researchers alike. As a decision-support system, the model allows users to simulate negotiation situations and estimate the likelihood of negotiation outcomes. As a research platform, it can generate simulation data in a cost- and time-effective way, allowing researchers to simulate complex, large-N studies at no cost or time. Originality/value The model presented in this paper synthesizes in a novel way a comprehensive range of concepts and theories of current negotiation research. It complements other computational models, in that it can simulate a more diverse range of negotiation strategies (distributive, integrative and compromise) and is applicable to a greater variety of negotiation scenarios."
KnolArthur2019Aasc,,Analyzing airport security checkpoint performance using cognitive agent models,"Knol, Arthur and Sharpanskykh, Alexei and Janssen, Stef",2019,Journal of air transport management,75,,39-50,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"Modern airports operate under high demands and pressures, and strive to satisfy many diverse, interrelated, sometimes conflicting performance goals. Airport performance areas, such as security, safety, and efficiency are usually studied separately from each other. However, operational decisions made by airport managers often impact several areas simultaneously. Current knowledge on how different performance areas are related to each other is limited. This paper contributes to filling this gap by identifying and quantifying relations and trade-offs between the detection performance of illegal items and the average queuing time at airport security checkpoints. These relations and trade-offs were analyzed by simulations with a cognitive agent model of airport security checkpoint operations. By simulation analysis a security checkpoint performance curve with three different regions was identified. Furthermore, the importance of focus on accuracy for a security operator is shown. The results of the simulation studies were related to empirical research at an existing regional airport. •Agent-based model of security checkpoint operations was developed.•A security checkpoint performance curve with three different regions was identified.•Results were related to empirical research at an existing regional airport."

In particular, the model captures explicitly the (stochastic) effect of interactions between heterogeneous agents during different economic activities on virus transmissions. The empirical validity of the model is established using data on economic and pandemic dynamics in Germany in the first 6 months after the COVID-19 outbreak. We show that a policy-inducing switch between a strict lockdown and a full opening-up of economic activity based on a high incidence threshold is strictly dominated by alternative policies, which are based on a low incidence threshold combined with a light lockdown with weak restrictions of economic activity or even a continuous weak lockdown. Furthermore, also the ex ante variance of the economic loss suffered during the pandemic is substantially lower under these policies. Keeping the other policy parameters fixed, a variation of the consumption restrictions during the lockdown induces a trade-off between GDP loss and mortality. Furthermore, we study the robustness of these findings with respect to alternative pandemic scenarios and examine the optimal timing of lifting containment measures in light of a vaccination rollout in the population."

Software agents, driven by reciprocity and hill-climbing heuristics and parameterized to replicate humans when property is exogenously protected, are employed to predict human behavior when property can be freely appropriated. Agents do not predict human behavior in a new set of experiments because subjects innovate, constructing a property convention of “mutual taking” in 5 out of the 6 experimental sessions that allows exchange to crowd out theft. When the same convention is made available to agents, they adopt it and again replicate human behavior. Property emerges as a social convention that exploits the capacity for reciprocity to sustain trade."

We provide a framework for value of information (VoI) analysis to identify key predictive uncertainties in a decision model. The approach addresses characteristics that complicate this analysis in environmental management: dependencies in the probability distributions of predictions, trade-offs between multiple objectives, and divergent stakeholder perspectives. For a coral reef fisheries case, we predict ecosystem and fisheries trajectories given different management alternatives with an agent-based model. We evaluate the uncertain predictions with preference models based on utility theory to find optimal alternatives for stakeholders. Using the expected value of partially perfect information (EVPPI), we measure how relevant resolving uncertainty for various decision attributes is. The VoI depends on the stakeholder preferences, but not directly on the width of an attribute’s probability distribution. Our approach helps reduce costs in structured decision-making processes by prioritizing data collection efforts.

Given a set of circumstances or processes, what other possible network shapes could have emerged? This is the problem of equifinality, where many different means could potentially arrive at the same end result: the networks that we observe. This paper outlines how agent-based modelling can be used as a laboratory for exploring different processes of archaeological network formation. We begin by describing our best guess about how the (ancient) world worked, given our target materials (here, the networks of production and patronage surrounding the Roman brick industry in the hinterland of Rome). We then develop an agent-based model of the Roman extractive economy which generates different kinds of networks under various assumptions about how that economy works. The rules of the simulation are built upon the work of Bang (2006; 2008) who describes a model of the Roman economy which he calls the 'imperial Bazaar'. The agents are allowed to interact, and the investigators compare the kinds of networks this description generates over an entire landscape of economic possibilities. By rigorously exploring this landscape, and comparing the resultant networks with those observed in the archaeological materials, the investigators will be able to employ the principle of equifinality to work out the representativeness of the archaeological network and thus the underlying processes."

Agent decisions are based on economic partial utilities. It’s a new computational tool using cellular and agent-based models. Decision processes are represented through computational agents. Land-use and land cover changes are represented through a cellular model. It belongs to kind of models called Multi-Agent Systems model of Land-Use Cover Change. Decisions concern the estate development in the neighborhood of the agents. Space is discretized in heterogeneous cells where heterogeneous agents interact together (directly or via space). Based on partial utility probabilities, several stochastic simulations are achieved. These simulations are then summarized, replicated and a parameter sensitivity analysis provided. The main parameters influencing the decisions of an agent depend on his type (ecologist, etc.) and on the expected economic activities in his neighborhood. Little information is assumed to be known about the mechanisms determining the parameter values guiding the decisions of the agents, except their type. The whole system constitutes a general virtual model, mostly independent from initial conditions and real data. Sensitivity analysis are used to explore behavioral paths and influencing parameters. In summary, the main contribution of this paper consists in: (i) defining a simulation-based framework for modeling the decisions of many heterogeneous economic agents involved in spatial interactions; (ii) capturing the decision process using general utility-based equations; (iii) providing a sensitivity analysis of initial parameter values. An example of possible application investigating strategies of various categories of agents (institutions, landowners, homeowners, etc.) facing an intense residential development is provided. The framework consists of abstracting institutional characteristics of actual local Urbanism Plan procedures in France. This model constitutes a first step to be further specified."

Versions of the WPMP have been implemented in New England, New York, the mid-Atlantic states, the Midwest, the Southwest, and California. Strong opposition to the WPMP persists among some industry stakeholders, however, due largely to a perceived lack of adequate performance testing. This study reports on the model development and open-source implementation (in Java) of a computational wholesale power market organized in accordance with core WPMP features and operating over a realistically rendered transmission grid. The traders within this market model are strategic profit-seeking agents whose learning behaviors are based on data from human-subject experiments. Our key experimental focus is the complex interplay among structural conditions, market protocols, and learning behaviors in relation to short-term and longer-term market performance. Findings for a dynamic 5-node transmission grid test case are presented for concrete illustration. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Martin and Alpizar, Francisco and Lindgren, Kristian",2018,Ecological economics,146,,347-358,,,Elsevier B.V,AMSTERDAM,"Successfully implemented payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs can provide both conservation of nature and financial support to rural communities. In this paper, we explore how PES programs can be designed so as to maximize the amount of additional ecosystem services provided for a given budget. We also provide a brief summary of the use of auction mechanisms in real world PES programs. To explore the potential additionality of different PES program designs we use a conceptual agent based simulation model where payments are either fixed, or set through a uniform or discriminatory auction. The program can also be designed to target payments to land-owners based on their provision of ecosystem services. Theoretically, auctions should be the most effective design, especially if payments are differentiated and targeted by ecosystem service provision. However, what we find is that the context in which the PES program is implemented—baseline compliance with program standards among the participants, correlation between opportunity costs and ecosystem services in the landscape, heterogeneity in costs and budget size—has a determining impact on the relative effectiveness of the different payment designs, with fixed payments schemes being much more effective than auctions in certain settings. Our findings suggest that context should be taken into serious consideration when a PES program design is chosen. •Context factors strongly influence the relative performance of PES design options.•Fixed payments can in certain contexts provide higher additionality than auctions.•If bidders learn the effectiveness of discriminatory auctions decreases over time.•Benefit targeting increases impacts, but introduces an efficiency-equity trade-off."

Due to the heterogeneity and the complexity of the interactions among human decision makers and potential trade-offs among natural and socio-economic losses and gains, a landuse transition agent-based model (LTABM) is developed to simulate landuse transitions with respect to several climate change scenarios and public policy interventions. It is expected that land managers' landuse decisions will be primarily dominated by profit maximizations, but also heavily driven by new technologies, risk perceptions and tax and subsidy policies. The results of this study will identify influential factors affecting landuse change, policy implementation hurdles, and alternate public policies leading to more sustainable landuse planning in the face of climate change."

In addition, the authors examine the transmission of crises from the banking sector to well-being and show that negative financial shocks have significant adverse effects.Design/methodology/approachThe authors employ agent-based modeling to test for the direct and indirect welfare effects of banking crises. The model includes a support vector machine (SVM) optimized subjective well-being function. The existing literature suggests that this is influenced by both the negative psychological effects of recessions and the adverse economic effects of income loss and increased unemployment.FindingsThe authors show that the different choices of policy response to a banking crisis carry different opportunity costs in terms of welfare and that societal preferences should be taken into account. The authors demonstrate that these effects influence different population classes in an asymmetric manner. Finally, the results demonstrate that the welfare loss of a bank failure is much higher than the cost of a bailout.Practical implicationsThe authors are able to propose to the authorities the best policy mix in order to handle banking crises in the most adequate manner, according to society's preferences between financial stability and public goods.Social implicationsThe findings extend the existing literature on subjective well-being, by quantifying the welfare cost of banking crises and showing that authorities should reconsider bank bailouts as a policy solution to bank distress.Originality/valueThe originality of this article lies in the use of an agent-based model to model the relationship between societal well-being and financial stability.

Design/methodology/approach A critical review of recent literature on new methodologies for financial economics. Findings Recent books have made important contributions to the study of financial economics. They suggest new approaches that include an emphasis on radical uncertainty, adaptive markets, agent-based modeling and narrative economics, as well as extensions of behavioral finance to include concepts such as diagnostic expectations. Many of these contributions can be seen more as complements than substitutes and provide fruitful directions for further research.

The result is a macroeconomic model that allows for the endogenous development of business cycles and stock price bubbles. We show that market sentiments exert important influence on the macroeconomy: Impulse-response functions of macroeconomic variables become more volatile which makes the effect of a given shock hard to predict. We also analyze the impact of different types of financial transaction taxes that are currently debated among policy makers (FTT, FAT, progressive FAT) and find that such taxes are well suited to stabilize the economy and raise funds from the financial sector as a contribution to the enormous costs created during the recent crisis. Our simulations suggest that the FTT leads to higher tax revenues and better stabilization results then the FAT. However, the FTT might also create huge distortion if set too high, a threat which the FAT does not imply."

We utilize the Correlates of War dataset to provide us with world wide historical defense alliance information. Using these networks as our initial conditions, we run the model forward from four prominent historical years and simulate the interactions that take place as well as the changes in overall wealth. Agents in the model employ a cost benefit analysis in their decision of whether or not to go to war.

As ABMS is used to model more and more complex systems, there is going to be an increase in the number of input variables used within the simulation. Any uncertainty associated with these input variables can be investigated using sensitivity analysis, but when there is uncertainty surrounding several of these input variables, a single parameter sensitivity analysis is not adequate. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) offers a way to sample variations in multiple parameters without having to consider all of the possible permutations. This paper introduces the application of LHS to ABMS via a case study that investigates the mortgage foreclosure contagion effect. This paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Traditionally, uncertainty surrounding a single input variable is investigated using sensitivity analysis. That is, the variable is allowed to change to determine the impact of this variation on the simulation's output. When there is uncertainty about multiple input variables, then the number of simulation runs required to undertake this investigation greatly increases due to the permutations that need to be considered. LHS, which was first derived by McKay et al., offers a proven mechanism to reduce the number of simulation runs needed to complete a sensitivity analysis. This paper describes the LHS technique and its applications to an agent-based simulation (ABS) for investigating the foreclosure contagion effect. Findings - The results from the foreclosure ABS runs have been characterized as ""good"", ""bad"" or ""ugly"", corresponding to whether or not a property market crash has occurred. As the only thing that can induce a property market crash within our model is the spread of foreclosing properties, these results indicate that the foreclosure contagion effect is dependent on how much impact a foreclosed property has on the price of the surrounding properties. Originality/value - This paper describes the application of LHS to an agent-based foreclosure simulation. The foreclosure model and its results have been described in Gangel et al. Given a certain output ""boundary"" found within these results, it was highly appropriate to conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis on the simulation's input variables. The outcome of the LHS sensitivity analysis has given further insight into the foreclosure contagion effect thus demonstrating it was a beneficial exercise."

Agent based frameworks allow for the faithful description of heterogeneous systems and are thus well suited for a detailed description of labor market dynamics. Here, we introduce rule-based modeling as a novel approach of agent-based modeling with regard to the description of labor market dynamics. We discuss its advantages and limitations, and we demonstrate that BioNetGen, an implementation of rule based modeling, can efficiently describe socio-economic interactions and that it compares favorably to other agent based softwares."

Angele",2009,Canadian journal of agricultural economics,57,4,481-496,,,Blackwell Publishing Inc,"Malden, USA","This paper presents a model of border enforcement in order to address trade-related invasive species risk. An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework was developed based on a theoretical economic model that incorporates a spatially explicit damage function. The framework was applied to a representative commodity (broccoli), invasive species (crucifer flea beetle), ports-of-entry (Calexico and Otay Mesa U.S./Mexico land ports), and vulnerable location (California). The ABM evaluated the economic impacts of port-specific and importer-specific enforcement regimes, enabling regulators to improve both the allocation of scarce enforcement resources and the effectiveness of current enforcement policies. The analysis generated several policy relevant findings concerning importing firm behavior and suggests conditions under which increasing enforcement may or may not significantly reduce invasive species risk and associated crop damages. The analysis illustrates that with a more realistic parameterization, the ABM could be used to make real-world policy decisions concerning allocation of limited resources across ports-of-entry. Dans le présent article, nous présentons un modèle de renforcement des frontières pour examiner le risque d'introduction d'espèces envahissantes par le biais d'échanges commerciaux. Nous avons élaboré un modèle multiagent fondé sur un modèle économique théorique qui intègre une fonction de dommage spatiale. Nous avons appliqué ce modèle à une denrée représentative (le brocoli), à une espèce envahissante (l'altise des crucifères), à des points d'entrée (les points d'entrée terrestre de Calexico et d'Otay Mesa à la frontière des États-Unis et du Mexique) et à un endroit vulnérable (la Californie). Le modèle multiagent a évalué les répercussions économiques des régimes de renforcement spécifiques à un point d'entrée et à un importateur, permettant aux organismes de réglementation d'améliorer à la fois l'allocation des ressources de renforcement qui sont rares et l'efficacité des politiques de renforcement actuelles. L'analyse a généré plusieurs résultats quant aux politiques concernant le comportement des entreprises importatrices et indique des conditions dans lesquelles l'accroissement du renforcement pourrait diminuer considérablement ou pas le risque d'introduction d'espèces envahissantes pouvant causer des dommages aux cultures. L'analyse a montré que, à l'aide d'une paramétrisation plus réaliste, le modèle multiagent pourrait être utilisé pour prendre des décisions stratégiques du monde réel quant à l'allocation des ressources limitées dans les points d'entrée."

Investigating product life spans and obsolescence in an agent-based model","Brouillat, Eric",2015,Journal of evolutionary economics,25,2,447-473,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"This article presents an agent-based simulation model that explores the dynamics of product life spans. The objective of this modeling exercise is to investigate the interplay between technological change and product life span in extended industrial dynamics. Change in product characteristics is driven by an endogenous stochastic process relying on the interplays between heterogeneous consumers and firms. Special attention is paid to demand-side modeling, which allows analyzing more thoroughly how decisions of bounded rational consumers affect the dynamics of the system. Although most existing models on product life span investigate durable goods monopolists, our study highlights the notion that diversity matters. Diversity of supply and demand in a bounded rationality context can push firms to market products with longer life spans, but their diffusion is restrained by the sensitivity of consumers to product obsolescence and their willingness to pay for longer-lasting products. The dynamics of consumer preferences influenced by firm marketing activities tend to maintain this situation which contributes to locking the market into short product-life trends. Unlocking the system requires changes in consumer behavior and better information about product life span and cost per use for consumers."

Four prototypical development regimes are identified from international practice: (1) the private developer-oriented Metroland model dating back to the suburbanisation of London in the nineteenth century England; (2) the private household-led special district model, which can be observed in many contemporary US suburbs; (3) the public planning-regulated model, as featured in most post-war European welfare state countries, including the present-day UK; (4) the public state-as-developer model, which characterises what has been taking place in China. A repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on the results of a large number of cellular automata simulations suggests no significant difference between models I and II in terms of their welfare outcomes measured by aggregate utility. However, models III and IV are both found to generate significantly less welfare than models I and II, under strict assumptions of zero transaction costs, perfect information, perfect capital markets and perfect competition."
AlaliyatSalehAbdel-Afou2019Amfe,,Agent-based modeling for environmental management. Case study: virus dynamics affecting Norwegian fish farming in fjords,"Alaliyat, Saleh Abdel-Afou",2019,,,,,,,The University of Bergen,,"Background: Norwegian fish-farming industry is an important industry, rapidly growing, and facing significant challenges such as the spread of pathogens1, trade-off between locations, fish production and health. There is a need for research, i.e. the development of theories (models), methods, techniques and tools for analysis, prediction and management, i.e. strategy development, policy design and decision making, to facilitate a sustainable industry. Loss due to the disease outbreaks in the aquaculture systems pose a large risk to a sustainable fish industry system, and pose a risk to the coastal and fjord ecosystem systems as a whole. Norwegian marine aquaculture systems are located in open areas (i.e. fjords) where they overlap and interact with other systems (e.g. transport, wild life, tourist, etc.). For instance, shedding viruses from aquaculture sites affect the wild fish in the whole fjord system. Fish disease spread and pathogen transmission in such complex systems, is process that it is difficult to predict, analyze, and control. There are several time-variant factors such as fish density, environmental conditions and other biological factors that affect the spread process. In this thesis, we developed methods to examine these factors on fish disease spread in fish populations and on pathogen spread in the time-space domain. Then we develop methods to control and manage the aquaculture system by finding optimal system settings in order to have a minimum infection risk and a high production capacity. Aim: The overall objective of the thesis is to develop agent-based models, methods and tools to facilitate the management of aquaculture production in Norwegian fjords by predicting the pathogen dynamics, distribution, and transmission in marine aquaculture systems. Specifically, the objectives are to assess agent-based modeling as an approach to understanding fish disease spread processes, to develop agent-based models that help us predict, analyze and understand disease dynamics in the context of various scenarios, and to develop a framework to optimize the location and the load of the aquaculture systems so as to minimize the infection risk in a growing fish industry. Methods: We use agent-based method to build models to simulate disease dynamics in fish populations and to simulate pathogen transmission between several aquaculture sites in a Norwegian fjord. Also, we use particle swarm optimization algorithm to identify agent-based models’ parameters so as to optimize the dynamics of the system model. In this context, we present a framework for using a particle swarm optimization algorithm to identify the parameter values of the agent-based model of aquaculture system that are expected to yield the optimal fish densities and farm locations that avoid the risk of spreading disease. The use of particle swarm optimization algorithm helps in identifying optimal agent-based models’ input parameters depending on the feedback from the agentbased models’ outputs. Results: As the thesis is built on three main studies, the results of the thesis work can be divided into three components. In the first study, we developed many agent-based models to simulate fish disease spread in stand-alone fish populations. We test the models in different scenarios by varying the agents (i.e. fish and pathogens) parameters, environment parameters (i.e. seawater temperature and currents), and interactions (interaction between agents-agents, and agents-environment) parameters. We use sensitivity analysis method to test different key input parameters such as fish density, fish swimming behavior, seawater temperature, and sea currents to show their effects on the disease spread process. Exploring the sensitivity of fish disease dynamics to these key parameters helps in combatting fish disease spread. In the second study, we build infection risk maps in a space-time domain, by developing agent-based models to identify the pathogen transmission patterns. The agent-based method helps us advance our understanding of pathogen transmission and builds risk maps to help us reduce the spread of infectious fish diseases. By using this method, we may study the spatial and dynamic aspects of the spread of infections and address the stochastic nature of the infection process. In the third study, we developed a framework for the optimization of the aquaculture systems. The framework uses particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize agent-based models’ parameters so as to optimize the objective function. The framework was tested by developing a model to find optimal fish densities and farm locations in marine aquaculture system in a Norwegian fjord. Results show so that the rapid convergence of the presented particle swarm optimization algorithm to the optimal solution, - the algorithm requires a maximum of 18 iterations to find the best solution which can increase the fish density to three times while keeping the risk of infection at an accepted level. Conclusion: There are many contributions of this research work. First, we assessed the agent-based modeling as a method to simulate and analyze fish disease spread dynamics as a foundation for managing aquaculture systems. Results from this study demonstrate how effective the use of agentbased method is in the simulation of infectious diseases. By using this method, we are able to study spatial aspects of the spread of fish diseases and address the stochastic nature of infections process. Agent-based models are flexible, and they can include many external factors that affect fish disease dynamics such as interactions with wild fish and ship traffic. Agent-based models successfully help us to overcome the problem associated with lack of data in fish disease transmission and contribute to our understanding of different cause-effects relationships in the dynamics of fish diseases. Secondly, we developed methods to build infection risk maps in a space-time domain conditioned upon the identification of the pathogen transmission patterns in such a space-time domain, so as to help prevent and, if needed, combat infectious fish diseases by informing the management of the fish industry in Norway. Finally, we developed a method by which we may optimize the fish densities and farm locations of aquaculture systems so as to ensure a sustainable fish industry with a minimum risk of infection and a high production capacity. This PhD study offers new research-based approaches, models and tools for analysis, predictions and management that can be used to facilitate a sustainable development of the marine aquaculture industry with a maximal economic outcome and a minimal environmental impact."

The basic simulation methods are discrete-event simulation (DES), agent-based modeling (ABM), and system dynamics (SD). Depending on the complexity of the problem, using a basic simulation method might not be enough to model construction works appropriately; hybrid approaches are needed. These are combinations of basic methods, or pairings with other techniques, such as fuzzy logic (FL) and neural networks (NNs). This paper presents a framework for applying simulation for problems within the field of construction. It describes DES, SD, and ABM, in addition to presenting how hybrid approaches are most useful in being able to reflect the dynamic nature of construction processes and capture complicated behavior, uncertainties, and dependencies. The examples show the application of the framework for masonry works and how it could be used for obtaining better productivity estimates. Several structures of hybrid simulation are presented alongside their inputs, outputs, and interaction points, which provide a practical reference for researchers on how to implement simulation to model construction systems of labor-intensive activities and lays the groundwork for applications in other construction-related activities."
CzuprynaMarcin2022Mmab,,Market makers activity: behavioural and agent based approach,"Czupryna, Marcin",2022,Central European journal of operations research,30,1,303-322,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"The goal of this paper is to verify how behavioural and social features influence the decisions of market makers and to identify the impact that such decisions have on the trade volume, price levels and bid-ask spreads observed in the market. Many classical microstructural models explain the rational behaviour of market makers. We can distinguish two main groups of such models: information-based models and inventory-based ones. On the one hand, information-based models emphasise the role of the informational asymmetry between market makers and informed traders. On the other hand, inventory-based models relate the behaviour of market makers to the current status of inventories. In particular, the objective of the market maker is to either avoid bankruptcy or merely maintain an inventory balance. It is known, however, that it is not just rational factors which may influence economic behaviour. In particular, based on the literature, we stipulate that such personal traits as risk attitude, impulsivity, social behaviour and sense of fairness may influence market makers’ behaviour. To verify this, we conducted a series of experiments with the goal of analysing the relation between these factors and market maker behaviour. Participants in these experiments played the role of a market maker in the simulated options market. Experimental data enabled us to analyse how the behavioural traits influence individual decisions. However, due to missing interactions among market makers during the experiment, the data did not enable us to analyse how these traits influence the aggregated observed markets parameters, such as trading volume and mean spread in a competitive market. Therefore, we propose a formal agent-based model that makes it possible to investigate how behavioural factors influence market variables such as price and volume by means of the simulation."

Cryptocurrency investment websites are currently experiencing rising demand, making them an appropriate site for paid advertisements. The above factors suggest the need for airlines to harvest cryptocurrency investment and platform users in their favour. To this end, it can be beneficial for airlines' web promotions to link certain web analytics metrics to cryptocurrency trading site metrics. For research purposes, web analytics data were monitored and gathered for 2 consecutive years from 10 globally leading cryptocurrency trading companies and 10 airline websites. A three-stage model was adopted by the authors. In the first stage, statistical analysis was implemented using cryptocurrency and airline metrics, followed by fuzzy cognitive mapping and agent-based modelling stages. The findings of the study indicate that engagement with cryptocurrency trading websites has a positive impact on airline websites' global ranking and visibility parameters. The outcomes of this research provide noteworthy digital marketing strategies which can be addressed by airline companies to increase their website visitors and optimise visibility parameters with the assistance of cryptocurrency trading websites."

These coordination decisions can have far-reaching and complex implications for overall food supply chain structural emergence, which in turn impacts system outcomes and long-term sustainability. In this paper, we describe an agent-based model that explores the impacts of farmer coordination decisions on the development of food supply chain structure over time. This model focuses on one type of coordination mechanism implementation method, in which coordinated farmer groups produce a single crop type and combine their yields to achieve economies of scale. The farmer agents' decisions to coordinate with one another depend on their evaluation of the tradeoff between their autonomy and the expected economic benefits of coordination. Each coordination decision is a bilateral process in which the terms of group reward sharing are negotiated. We capture the effects of farmers' size, income, and autonomy premia, as well as volume-price relationships and group profit-sharing rules, on the rate of farmer coordination and the number and size of groups that form. Results indicate that under many conditions, coordination groups tend to consolidate over time, which suggests implications for overall supply chain structural resilience."

Much is hidden in innovative tax shelters combining multiple business structures such as partnerships, trusts, and S-corporations into complex transaction networks designed to reduce and obscure the true tax liabilities of their individual shareholders. One known gambit employed by these shelters is to offset real gains in one part of a portfolio by creating artificial capital losses elsewhere through the mechanism of “inflated basis” (TaxAnalysts 2005 ), a process made easier by the relatively flexible set of rules surrounding “pass-through” entities such as partnerships (IRS 2009 ). The ability to anticipate the likely forms of emerging evasion schemes would help auditors develop more efficient methods of reducing the tax gap. To this end, we have developed a prototype evolutionary algorithm designed to generate potential schemes of the inflated basis type described above. The algorithm takes as inputs a collection of asset types and tax entities, together with a rule-set governing asset exchanges between these entities. The schemes produced by the algorithm consist of sequences of transactions within an ownership network of tax entities. Schemes are ranked according to a “fitness function” (Goldberg in Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Addison-Wesley, Boston, 1989 ); the very best schemes are those that afford the highest reduction in tax liability while incurring the lowest expected penalty."

YamamotoRyuichi2019DPSA,,DYNAMIC PREDICTOR SELECTION AND ORDER SPLITTING IN A LIMIT ORDER MARKET,"Yamamoto, Ryuichi",2019,Macroeconomic dynamics,23,5,1757-1792,,,Cambridge University Press,"New York, USA","Recent empirical research has documented the clustered volatility and fat tails of return distribution in stock markets, yet returns are uncorrelated over time. Certain agent-based theoretical models attempt to explain the empirical features in terms of investors' order-splitting or dynamic switching strategies, both of which are frequently used by actual stock investors. However, little theoretical research has discriminated among the behavioral assumptions within a model and compared the impacts of the assumptions on the empirical features. Nor has the research simultaneously replicated the return features and empirical features on market microstructure, such as patterns of order choice. This study constructs an artificial limit order market in which investors split orders into small pieces or use fundamental and trend-following predictors interchangeably over time. We demonstrate that, on one hand, the market that features strategies with order splitting and dynamic predictor selection can independently replicate clustered volatility and fat tails with near-zero return autocorrelations. However, we also show that patterns of order choice do not match those found in certain previous empirical studies in both types of economies. Thus, we conclude that, in reality, the two strategies can work to generate the empirical return features but that investors may also use other strategies in actual stock markets. We also demonstrate that the impact of both strategies on the volatility persistence tends to be greater as the number of traders increases in the market; this finding implies that the order-splitting strategy and dynamic predictor selection are more crucial for the empirical phenomena pertaining to larger capital stocks."

The expected frequency of this type of behavior, however, remains an open and important question, and limited access to detailed election data makes it difficult to resolve empirically. In this paper, we develop a spatial model of voting behavior to approach the question theoretically. We conclude that monotonicity failures in three-candidate IRV elections may be much more prevalent than widely presumed (results suggest a lower bound estimate of 15 % for competitive elections). In light of these results, those seeking to implement a fairer multi-candidate election system should be wary of adopting IRV."

Striving for realism for its own sake does not advance understanding; however, making sure that a model provides valid insights is a useful goal.

Findings The authors find that critiques that do not offer a more valid alternative model do not necessarily advance the production of science. Practical implications Decision makers need to understand the assumptions and limitations of the models that they are using, but they should also be educated on the basic concepts of modeling literacy, and develop an understanding that all models are necessarily incomplete, as to make a model a perfect reflection of the real world would not provide insightful generalizations.

Alien plant pests are introduced into new areas at unprecedented rates through global trade, transport, tourism and travel, threatening biodiversity and agriculture. Increasingly, the movement and introduction of pests is analysed with pathway models to provide risk managers with quantitative estimates of introduction risks and effectiveness of management options. Pathway models vary greatly in mathematical form, level of detail, treatment of uncertainty and variability, as well as terminology. We conducted an overview and cluster analysis of pathway models to guide risk assessors, risk managers and model developers. We performed divisive hierarchical clustering on models retrieved from the peer-reviewed and grey literature to characterise and categorize the currently used modelling approaches. We distinguish two clusters of models based on product volume flows and two clusters of models based on the movement of individual agents. The first cluster of flow-based models describes a flow of infested material from origins to destinations according to fixed partitioning coefficients. These deterministic models can account for consequences of parameter variability and uncertainty. The second and third clusters of pathway models incorporate stochasticity in processes, and are respectively flow-based or agent-based. Models in the fourth cluster account for interactions between agents and nodes in the pathway. Conceptually, there are no fundamental differences between epidemic network models and this last cluster of pathway models. The choice of pathway model depends on the aim of the risk assessment, the available time, expertise and data. Models in clusters 2, 3, and 4 add sophistication and insight in variability to pathway analysis, but under time and data constraints, key objectives of risk assessors and managers can be addressed with models in cluster 1. The four clusters represent a comprehensive and fit for purpose toolbox of models."

We introduce a modified Taylor rule that includes the financial position of firms as a target. Monte Carlo simulations provide a representation of the complex feedback effects generated by the interaction among the different transmission channels of monetary policy. The model also reproduces the evidence of low inflation during stock market booms and shows how it can lead to overinvestment and destabilize the system. The paper also investigates the possible reasons behind this stylized fact by testing different behavioral rules for the central bank. We find that, in a context of sticky prices and volatile expectations, endogenous credit creation can be identified as the main source of the divergent dynamics of prices in the real and financial sectors."

( 2008 ). Dynamic traffic flows of a multi-agent transport simulation are linked to detailed air pollution emission factors. The monetary equivalent of emissions is internalized in a policy which is then used as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of a regulatory measure—a speed limitation to 30 km / h in the inner city of Munich. The calculated toll, which is equal to simulated marginal costs in terms of individual vehicle attributes and time-dependent traffic states, results in average air pollution costs that are very close to values in the literature. It is found that the regulatory measure is considerably less successful in terms of total emission reduction. It reduces emissions of urban travelers too strongly while even increasing the emissions of commuters and freight, both leading to a increase in deadweight loss. That is, the regulatory measure leads to higher market inefficiencies than a “do-nothing” strategy: too high generalized prices for urban travelers, too low generalized prices for commuters and freight. Finally, long-term changes in the vehicle fleet fuel efficiency are assumed as a reaction to the Internalization policy. The results indicate, however, that the long-term effect of emission reduction is dominated by the short-term reactions and by the assumed improvement in fleet fuel efficiency; the influence of the resulting route and mode choice decisions turns out to be relatively small."

Is complexity theory an alternative explanation to competitive selection for the emergent order apparent in coevolutionary industry groups? The biologist Stewart Kauffman suggests a theory of complexity catastrophe offering universal principles explaining phenomena normally attributed to Darwinian natural selection theory. Kauffman's complexity theory seems to apply equally well to firms in coevolutionary pockets. Based on complexity theory, four kinds of complexity are identified. Kauffman's "" NK [ C ] model"" is positioned ""at the edge of chaos"" between complexity driven by ""Newtonian"" simple rules and rule-driven deterministic chaos. Kauffman's insight, which is the basis of the findings in this paper, is that complexity is both a consequence and a cause. Multicoevolutionary complexity in firms is defined by moving natural selection processes inside firms and down to a ""parts"" level of analysis, in this instance Porter's value chain level, to focus on microstate activities by agents. The assumptions of stochastically idiosyncratic microstates and coevolution in firms are analyzed. Competitive advantage, as a dependent variable, is defined in terms of Nash equilibrium fitness levels. This allows a translation of Kauffman's theory to firms, paying particular attention to (1) how value chain landscapes might be modeled, (2) assumptions underlying Kauffman's models making them amenable to firms, and (3) a delineation of seven of Kauffman's computational experiments. As part of the translation, possible parallels between the application of complexity catastrophe theory to coevolutionary pockets and studies by institutional theorists and social network analysts are discussed. The models derive from spin-glass microstate models resulting in Boolean games. Kauffman's Boolean statistical mechanics is introduced in developing the logic underlying the somewhat simplified NK [ C ] model. The model allows the use of computational experiments to better understand how the dependent variable—value chain fitness—is affected by changes in the number of internal interdependencies K , the number of coevolutionary links with opponents C , the size of the coevolutionary pocket S , and the number of simultaneous adaptive changes, among other things. Various computational experiments are presented that suggest strategic organizing approaches most likely to foster competitive advantage. High or low Nash equilibrium fitness levels are shown to result from internal and external coevolutionary densities as a function of links among value chain competencies within a firm and between a firm and an opponent. Complexity phenomena appear to suggest a number of expected (and thus validating) and surprising strategies with respect to complex organizational interdependencies. For example, moderate complexity fares best and external coevolutionary complexity sets an upper bound to advantages likely to be gained from internal complexity. Various complexity ""lessons"" are discussed. Models such as the NK [ C ] could offer insights into strategic organizing."

The club approach begins with a small number of enthusiastic countries. This paper asks under what conditions such clubs are likely to evolve into effective cooperation through side-payments to new members. The question is addressed through a range of formal thought experiments using numerical simulations. The model is calibrated using empirical data on countries’ emissions, GDP, populations, and vulnerabilities. It is simple and stylized, but allows for complex and dynamic interactions between actors. Basic equity considerations can be accommodated. The results indicate that side-payments’ theoretical potential for facilitating effective clubs is large. One or two large emitters can initiate a club that grows to cover a substantial share of global emissions if the global benefit–cost ratio for mitigation is around 3 or larger. The size of stable clubs is larger if new members contribute to making side-payments, and somewhat lower if equity considerations constrain the set of possible transfers. Side-payments’ effect is enabled by the large asymmetries between countries. Total side-payment flows range from tens to hundreds of billions of US dollars annually."

This study aims to reveal the dynamic mechanisms underlying the relationship between a distribution network and two types of flexibility: adaptive and proactive. Design/methodology/approach The authors apply agent-based modeling to simulate a three-level distribution network. First, a program of 14 segmentations across 4 stages is developed using NetLogo software. Using data on Company X’s distribution network, the authors simulate a distribution network when either adaptive or proactive flexibility is implemented and compare the performance outcomes of the distribution network. Finally, by using the database generated from an experiment designed with BehaviorSpace, the authors conduct a general linear regression analysis to analyze the effect of network structure on the performance of the distribution network. Findings The authors find that the implementation of adaptive flexibility is connected with a higher level of trust and a lower level of inventory, whereas the implementation of proactive flexibility is associated with a higher level of satisfaction but a higher level of inventory. Also, this study’s analyses show that adaptive flexibility emphasizes short-term efficiency, whereas proactive flexibility put more emphasis on long-term effectiveness. In addition, the authors find that network structure has a significant effect on the distribution network by influencing inventory, satisfaction and trust. Originality/value Theoretically, this study’s results further develop the research on channel management by revealing the interaction between distribution networks and two types of flexibility from a dynamic (rather than static) perspective. Also, the findings help in explaining how network structure can affect the performance of a distribution network. In practice, the results also guide the focal firm in distribution channels to make strategic decisions between adaptive and proactive flexibility to improve channel performance."

We develop a model in which margin procyclicality and the propensity for liquidity hoarding interact to generate a systemic liquidity crisis. In this model, banks lend and borrow in the interbank market to mitigate liquidity risk and trade derivatives contracts in the OTC derivatives market to mitigate market risk. The daily mark-to-market of derivatives contracts results in daily margin calls that banks cover using high quality liquid assets. We find that distress due to margin procyclicality in the derivatives market can spillover to the interbank market leading to systemic liquidity risk. Interconnectedness further amplifies the effects of systemic risk within the interbank market. The model shows that central clearing might increase the possibility of systemic liquidity risk due to tight margin requirements and the timing of cash flows required from banks. We also find that haircut levels affect the possibility of systemic liquidity risk, and highlight the potential role of a market maker of last resort in limiting this possibility."

These systems are typically highly dynamic and hard to predict, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change, where novel sets of conditions drive coupled socio-economic-environmental responses. Faced with these challenges, our tools for policy development, while informed by the past experience, must not be unduly constrained; they must allow equally for both the fine-tuning of successful existing approaches and the generation of novel ones in unbiased ways. We study ocean fisheries as an example class of complex human–environmental systems, and present a new model (POSEIDON) and computational approach to policy design. The model includes an adaptive agent-based representation of a fishing fleet, coupled to a simplified ocean ecology model. The agents (fishing boats) do not have programmed responses based on empirical data, but respond adaptively, as a group, to their environment (including policy constraints). This conceptual model captures qualitatively a wide range of empirically observed fleet behaviour, in response to a broad set of policies. Within this framework, we define policy objectives (of arbitrary complexity) and use Bayesian optimization over multiple model runs to find policy parameters that best meet the goals. The trade-offs inherent in this approach are explored explicitly. Taking this further, optimization is used to generate novel hybrid policies. We illustrate this approach using simulated examples, in which policy prescriptions generated by our computational methods are counterintuitive and thus unlikely to be identified by conventional frameworks."

Targeting of agri-environmental measures (AEMs) is a key to increasing the cost-effectiveness of governmental support for biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services from agriculture. Existing literature, however, often focuses on single measures without considering that policies are usually bundles of different measures addressing multiple non-marketed goods and services. Thus, interaction effects of a set of policies in a given policy mix may influence the cost-effectiveness of single measures. Recently, Swiss agricultural policy was redesigned using the Tinbergen rule as its basis, i.e., a single measure for each policy goal, including additional targeted direct payments. This facilitates testing for interaction effects of multiple targeted AEMs. Here we use a social-ecological, agent-based modelling framework to assess interaction effects of these agricultural policies while accounting for climate change impacts in our analysis. The results from our case study in a mountain region show that ecosystem service provision increases with targeted payments. However, interaction effects of the different targeted policies affect the provision levels of all goods and services. In particular, changes at the extensive margin, i.e., the total amount of land that is under production, largely determine the amount of ecosystem services provided. Thus, climate change driven productivity increases and policies that keep land in production may substantially support the provision of non-marketed goods and services in marginal agricultural production regions with a high potential for land abandonment. Consequently, the effectiveness of targeted policy measures should also consider changes at the extensive margin and be assessed in the context of bundles or portfolios of different policy measures."
WoodAaronD2014Teoe,,"The evolution of energy markets over time: An examination of OPEC, the Seven Sisters, and oil market dominance through the use of evolutionary game theory and agent-based modeling","Wood, Aaron D",2014,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The overarching agenda of this work is to develop a methodological toolkit to contend with a class of applied problems, particularly within energy economics, in which behavioral economics and game theory intersect. Specifically, this work intends to address problems, both in energy applications and throughout economics, in which boundedly-rational agents driven by heuristics and emotion interact in dynamic, strategic situations. This type of problem is not currently addressed using orthodox economic modeling techniques, and because many issues within energy meet the above criteria, the intertemporal development of energy markets is not thoroughly understood. To provide a means to examine this class of problem, I combine evolutionary game theory and agent-based modeling into one comprehensive methodological toolkit. Then, I examine one historical example within the energy industry that is anecdotally well known but theoretically unexplained to shed insight into a long-standing puzzle and to calibrate this new toolkit. That is, I study the evolution of petroleum markets during the 1960s and 1970s, focusing on the struggle between the Seven Sisters major oil firms and OPEC nations as they grappled for control over prices and production. In terms of construction, I first provide an introduction to the dissertation, and I then offer a historical exposition of the epoch of interest. Next, I examine evolutionary game theory and agent-based modeling individually as methodological tools within the social sciences. I then examine the historical period through applied evolutionary game theory and agent-based modeling. Subsequently, I argue for the advancement of economics as an evolutionary science and justify the use of this toolkit by examining the applied energy problem through traditional game theoretic approaches. Lastly, I provide a conclusion. The first contribution of this work to the literature is that this methodological toolkit has not been utilized to address applied problems within economics. The second contribution is pursuing the study of the unexplained type of problem mentioned above that includes the evolution of energy markets. Since the struggle between OPEC and the Seven Sisters is not sufficiently theoretically understood, the use of this toolkit to address this specific example is the third contribution of this dissertation. In short, I combine two innovative techniques, and I select an archetypal energy problem as a mean to calibrate this new methodological toolkit to test and prepare it for future work in the study of energy markets."
FitzpatrickMadison2015AMoM,,Agent-Based Modeling of Mode Choice with Dynamic Attitudes and Social Influence,"Fitzpatrick, Madison",2015,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Models of travel behavior are important tools for understanding how people make choices in the context of everyday activity and travel, and they are used to help predict the consequences of infrastructure and policy decisions. Traditionally, these models were built on a foundation of economic theory, and they focused on representing calculated trade-offs between factors such as time, money, and comfort. However, research on the psychology of human decision-making has made it clear that our decisions may be driven as much by social influence, personal bias, and habit as by reasoned trade-offs. In addition, we often make decisions in concert with others, whether for the purpose of participating in activities together or sharing limited resources. Considering this, it is clear that social and psychological factors could be crucial drivers of travel patterns. Recent studies have shown that these factors do have important effects, and this topic is the focus of increasing interest in the transportation community. This research is designed to contribute to our understanding of travel behavior by investigating the effects of modeling dynamic attitudes and social interactions in an agent-based travel behavior simulation. There are three valuable insights that this work aims to generate. The first is a fuller understanding of how to simulate these cognitive processes in a way that best reflects our current knowledge of how they work and what their effects are. The second is an understanding of how the specification of model parameters related to these behavioral processes affects mode attitudes and the resulting mode shares. The third is an understanding of how characteristics of the transportation network or the population can affect these two outcomes, and how the inclusion of these additional cognitive processes changes these effects. An initial study was carried out using a small-scale transportation network and population, implemented in the Netlogo agent-based modeling platform. The goal was to construct a model in which mode choice depends in part on attitudes about travel modes. These attitudes evolve over the course of the simulation in response to experiences on the transportation network and influence from the social network, which also changes dynamically. The advantage of this platform was that it provided a practical framework to explore modeling assumptions without the necessity of collecting empirical data. However, this initial study made clear that there would be additional value in testing such a model in larger-scale, more realistic context. Thus, the model was implemented with additional improvements in MATSim, a transportation simulation software package that provided the capability to apply the model to the city of Chicago. A series of simulations were conducted to address the second and third research goals described above. The results indicate that the inclusion of dynamic attitudes and social networks in a mode choice model leads to some surprising findings that merit further exploration. For example, in these simulations, social influence plays a much greater role than travel experience memories in the process of dynamically updating mode attitudes. Interestingly, there is potentially a tipping point phenomena occurring in the social network, in which an abrupt change in mode share takes place midway through the simulation. Initial mode attitudes have strong effects on the mode share outcomes, while mode performance levels have surprisingly little impact. Further simulation and analysis would be necessary to verify the hypothesized underlying causes of these observations, but it is clear that the inclusion of dynamic attitudes and social networks in a model of mode choice provides a framework for studying cognitive processes that may have a significant affect on travel behavior."

The context in which the biogas plant manager needs to purchase the feedstock could be important when the biomass is also used in valorization trajectories besides anaerobic digestion. Using a combination of qualitative research and agent-based modelling, we investigated the effect of market context on the purchase of local biomass for anaerobic digestion. This paper details the institutional arrangements of our case study, the silage maize market in Flanders and the results of a scenario analysis, simulating nine different market contexts. Silage maize is an interesting case study, as it is both used for feed by farmers and as an input in biogas plants. The results show that mainly the time of entry into the market explains the difficulties in obtaining a stable supply of silage maize to biogas plants. Furthermore, we found a silage maize price increase for farmers in competition with a biogas plant, especially in case of a silage maize deficit in the market. The different institutional arrangements used have no significant effect. Our findings may guide biogas plant managers in assessing and reducing the consequences of the establishment of a biogas plant, competing for local biomass resources."

Viewed through the lens of the telecoupling framework, land use and food consumption are linked across local to global scales by decision-making agents and trade flows. Quantitatively modeling the dynamics of telecoupled systems like this could be achieved using numerous different modelling approaches. For example, previous approaches to modelling global food trade have often used partial equilibrium economic models, whereas recent approaches to representing local land use decision-making have widely used agent-based modelling. System dynamics models are well established for representing aggregated flows and stores of products and values between distant locations. We argue that hybrid computational models will be useful for capitalising on the strengths these different modelling approaches each have for representing the various concepts in the telecoupling framework. However, integrating multiple modelling approaches into hybrid models faces challenges, including data requirements and uncertainty assessment. To help guide the development of hybrid models for investigating sustainability through the telecoupling framework here we examine important representational and modelling considerations in the context of global food trade and local land use. We report on the development of our own model that incorporates multiple modelling approaches in a modular approach to negotiate the trade-offs between ideal representation and modelling resource constraints. In this initial modelling our focus is on land use and food trade in and between USA, China and Brazil, but also accounting for the rest of the world. We discuss the challenges of integrating multiple modelling approaches to enable analysis of agents, flows, and feedbacks in the telecoupled system. Our analysis indicates differences in representation of agency are possible and should be expected in integrated models. Questions about telecoupling dynamics should be the primary driver in selecting modelling approaches, tempered by resource availability. There is also a need to identify appropriate modelling assessment and analysis tools and learn from their application in other domains."

The plethora of solutions to these dilemmas suggests that people make different kinds of decision in different situations. Rather than trying to find a unifying kind of reasoning to capture all situations, as the paradigm of rationality has done, this article develops a framework of agent decision-making for social simulation, that takes seriously both different kinds of decision making as well as different interpretations of situations. The Contextual Action Framework for Computational Agents allows for the modelling of complex social phenomena, like dilemma situations, with relatively simple agents by shifting complexity from an agent’s cognition to an agent’s context."

On one hand, agricultural land and grassland need to be used to support human food requirements. On the other hand, these land uses create trade-offs with other ecosystem functions, assets and services, such as ecological connectivity, biodiversity and natural habitat maintenance. In this paper a prototype web-based dashboard is presented, that aims at allowing a fully-fledged calculation of the economic and environmental trade-offs between different land uses of any land patch (excluding urban areas and infrastructures) and in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. An agent-based model (ABM) coupled with life-cycle assessment (LCA) runs on the background of the dashboard. The coupled model allows the simulation of the farm business and the calculation of the revenues made by farmers in every land patch under different farm management scenarios. Crossing the information coming from the model with other tools would also allow to integrate local environmental trade-offs, such as degradation of local habitats or ecological connectivity, and not only global ones defined in a non-spatialized way. The dashboard has a potentially high value to inform policy, strategies, or specific actions (e.g., environmental stewardship programs that integrate economic convenience as a condition) and has the necessary flexibility to integrate new aspects related to territorial analyses as they become available."
KoppT2018IITb,,Identifying Influential Traders by Agent Based Modelling,"Kopp, T and Salecker, J",2018,,,,,,,,,"Understanding individual traders' channel choices is important to policy makers because it yields information on which channels are effective in transmitting information. Since trading networks are characterised by feedback mechanisms along several dimensions they can be understood as complex adaptive systems. Conventional approaches, such as regression analysis, face severe drawbacks when modelling these since endogeneity is omnipresent. Instead, they are best studied via agent based modelling. This paper applies an ABM to the empirical example of rubber trade in Indonesia, which is a dense network. Results indicate that the decision for traders' channel choices are mostly driven by physical distance and debt obligations, and to a minor extent by peer-interaction.

Urban economics and hedonic analysis are combined in a bilateral trade market with a GIS landscape. Merging empirical data from various sources requires adjustment of the empirical demand for housing to the simulated one. Heterogeneity in agents incomes and preferences is essential when modeling heterogeneous housing goods. Market with adaptive price expectation produces non-marginal changes in price dynamics. This paper introduces an economic agent-based model of an urban housing market. The RHEA (Risks and Hedonics in Empirical Agent-based land market) model captures natural hazard risks and environmental amenities through hedonic analysis, facilitating empirical agent-based land market modeling. RHEA is well grounded in economic theory and uses rich spatial data and econometric analysis. It moves beyond the existing work by explicitly simulating the emergence of property prices and their spatial distribution under adaptive price expectations of heterogeneous agents, advancing toward empirical modeling of agent-based land markets. At the same time RHEA operates in a realistic GIS landscape where realtor and households agents form ask and bid prices using empirical hedonic price functions. The simulation results demonstrate that this combination of theoretically sound micro-foundations in agents’ behavior and empirical data is feasible. This opens opportunities to explore various methodological and policy-relevant research questions including exploration of abrupt non-marginal changes in markets and regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems."

Much less, however, is known about the seller’s preferred selling method when the buyers have a common value of the item. Our objective is to determine if a first-price auction or a posted-price market provides a seller with the larger expected revenue when buyers have a common value of the item being sold. An agent-based posted-price market and an agent-based first-price common-value auction with a reserve price are developed to compare these selling methods. Holding the buyers’ uncertainty about the value of the item constant, the seller prefers the posted-price market when the seller has no uncertainty about the item’s value. When the seller has an equal level of uncertainty as the buyers, the seller’s expected revenue for each market is similar. As the seller’s uncertainty increases beyond the level of the buyers’ uncertainty, the auction with a reserve price eventually becomes the preferred choice."

To date, scenario studies of infrastructure build-up and sales of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are driven by cost estimates and technological feasibility assumptions, indicating that there is a ""chicken and egg problem""; Car producers do not offer FCVs as long as there are no hydrogen filling stations, and infrastructure will not be set up unless there is a significant number of FCVs on the road. This diffusion barrier is often used as an argument for a major-(public) infrastructure program, neglecting the fact that the automobile market is highly competitive and car producers, consumers, and filling station operators form an interdependent dynamic system, where taxes influence technology choice. In this paper, an agent-based model is used that captures the main interdependencies to simulate possible diffusion paths of FCVs. The results suggest that a tax on conventional cars can successfully promote diffusion even without a major infrastructure program. However, consumers and individual producers are affected differently by the tax, indicating that differently strong resistance towards such a policy can be anticipated. Moreover, there is evidence that some producers might benefit from cooperation with filling station operators to generate a faster build-up of infrastructure."

The model uses the concepts of transition theory as a framework for assessing possible pathways by which a transition to a sustainable mobility society might happen. The modelling approach combines agent-based modelling techniques with a system dynamics structure. It is original in that there are two levels of agent. There are a small number of complex agents, which have an internal structure and are therefore subsystems within society, and a larger number of simple agents. Based on the UK data, the results show that Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) come to dominate, but only in the very long run (after 2030), while biofuels and ICE (Internal Combustion Engine)-electric hybrids are the main alternatives to the regime in the next 10–30 years, because a) they are already developed and b) they fit better into current infrastructures. The model shows that technological transitions are most likely. Lifestyle change transitions require sustained pressure from the environment on society and behavioural change from consumers."

The paper investigates the effect of over-responding, i.e. dispatching ambulances even for doubtful high-risk patients, on the performance of equity constrained emergency medical services. Design/methodology/approach Agent-based modeling and simulation was used to evaluate two different dispatching policies: first, a policy based on maximum reward, and second, a policy based on the Markov decision process formulation. Four equity constraints were used: two from the patients’ side and two from the providers’ side. Findings The Markov decision process formulation, solved using value iteration method, performed better than the maximum reward method in terms of number of patients served. As the equity constraints conflict with each other, at most three equity constraints could be enforced at a time. The study revealed that it is safe to over-respond if there is uncertainty in the risk level of the patients. Research limitations/implications Further research is required to understand the implications of under-responding, where doubtful high-risk patients are denied an ambulance service. Practical implications The need for good triage system is apparent as over-responding badly affects the operational budget. The model can be used for evaluating various dispatching policy decisions. Social implications Emergency medical services have to ensure efficient and equitable provision of services, from the perception of both patients and service providers. Originality/value The paper applies agent-based modeling to equity constrained emergency medical services and highlights findings that are not reported in the existing literature."
GreiffMatthias2013Ratp,,Rewards and the private provision of public goods on dynamic networks,"Greiff, Matthias",2013,Journal of evolutionary economics,23,5,1001-1021,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"We study an evolutionary model of a public good game with rewards played on a network. Giving rewards to contributors transforms the game but gives rise to a second-order dilemma. By allowing for coevolution of strategies and network structure, the evolutionary dynamics operate on both structure and strategy. Players learn with whom to interact and how to act and can overcome the second-order dilemma. More specifically, the network represents social distance which changes as players interact. Through the change in social distance, players learn with whom to interact, which we model using reinforcement dynamics. We find that, for certain parameter constellations, a social institution, prescribing prosocial behavior and thus solving the second-order dilemma, can emerge from a population of selfish players. Due to the dynamic structure of the network, the institution has an endogenous punishment mechanism ensuring that defectors will be excluded from the benefits of the institution and the public good will be supplied efficiently."

Institutional change driven by liberalization, changing economic competitiveness of the dominant fuels, new technologies, and changing end-user preferences regarding electricity supply are some examples of these developments. This paper explores plausible transition trajectories in the face of these developments given technological uncertainty about investment and operating costs, and fuel efficiency of various alternative technologies; political uncertainty about future CO 2 abatement policies such as emission trading; and socio-economic uncertainty about fuel prices, investment decisions of suppliers, and load curves. Various alternative developments for these uncertainties are specified. The consequences of each of these alternative developments are assessed using an agent-based model of the Dutch electricity system. The outputs are analyzed using various data-mining and data visualization techniques in order to reveal arch-typical transition trajectories and their conditions for occurring. Policy recommendations are derived from this. The results indicate that most transition trajectories point towards a future energy supply system that is reliant on clean coal and gas. Under the explored uncertainties, only rarely a transition to renewables occurs. The various sustainable energy support programs appear to be ineffective in steering the energy supply system towards a more sustainable mode of functioning across the various uncertainties."

In this paper we are focused on agent-based modelling and simulations, which emerged in the last two decades as a new approach. Autonomous and interacting intelligent agents are able to model and simulate complex systems in the business sphere. With the use of agent-based modelling and simulations we are able to understand how macro level outcomes are affected by micro level processes and vice versa. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the paper is to introduce recent development in the area of agent-based modelling and simulations focused on the business domain. Managers often have to make difficult decisions under the uncertainty and high risks. Agent-based modelling can provide powerful tools for lowering those risks through a possibility of running experiments, which is normally impossible in economics. In the second part we want to support the usefulness of agent-based simulations with our own simulations. Methods: The method used in this article is an agent-based simulation in a multi-agent system. We use a framework called MAREA. It is a simulation environment with integrated ERP system based on REA ontology. Our simulation model is based on a retail company that sells electronics. For simplicity, in our setup we trade with computer cables. Findings & Value added: In our simulations we experimented with the quality of sales service provided by company’s sales representatives. We investigated the impact of quality of sales service on company KPIs under the changing environment circumstances represented by disturbance agent. The quality of sales service is a part of quality of service and thus it affects the perception of brand and loyalty of customers towards the company. In our simulation setup we work with two types of customers, long-term customers and new ones. The result is that quality of sales service has mostly positive effects on company KPIs."

Remedies for this market failure are defended by some authors and rejected by others. One of the issues discussed is the role that the competition for positional goods may have in generating technological innovation. This article aims to contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of this process through the use of an agent-based model. Simulations show a plausible dynamics of the process of technological innovation as generated by consumption of positional nature. An interpretation of the results in the scope of the policy discussion in question is provided. The influence of key factors such as income inequality, the materialization of the Hirsch conjecture, and characteristics of the network of relative preferences, is analised. We also frame the potential interest of positional consumption and this model in particular in the context of the ongoing discussion among evolutionary economists on the behaviour of demand."

It is an updated and improved version of the original “battle of perspectives” model, described in Janssen ( 1996 ) and Janssen/de Vries ( 1998 ). The model integrates agents with differing beliefs about economic growth and the sensitivity of the climate system and places them in environments corresponding or non-corresponding to their beliefs. In a second step, different agent types are ruling the world conjointly. Using a learning procedure based on some operators known from Genetic Algorithms, the model shows how they adapt wrong beliefs over time. It is thus an evolutionary model of climate protection decisions. The paper argues that such models may help in analyzing why cost-minimizing protection paths, derived from integrated assessment models à la Nordhaus/Sztorc ( 2013 ), are not followed. Although this view is supported by numerous authors, few such models exist. With the “battle of perspectives 2.0” the paper offers a contribution to their development. Compared to the former version, more agent types are considered and more aspects have been endogenized."

Tobin taxes and market crashes,"Lavička, H. and Lichard, T. and Novotný, J.",2016,International review of financial analysis,47,,328-342,,,Elsevier Inc,NEW YORK,"The recent economic crisis revived interest in financial transaction taxes (FTTs) as a means to offset negative risk externalities. However, up-to-date academic research does not provide sufficient insights into the effects of transaction taxes on financial markets as the literature has here-to-fore been focused too narrowly on Gaussian variance as a measure of volatility. In this paper, we argue that it is imperative to understand the relationship between price jumps, Gaussian variance, and FTTs. While Gaussian variance is not necessarily a problem in itself, the non-normality of return distribution caused by price jumps affects not only the performance of many risk-hedging algorithms but directly influences the frequency of catastrophic market events. To study the aforementioned relationship, we use an agent-based model of financial markets. Its results show that the relationship between FTTs and price jumps is intricate. This result implies that regulators may face a trade-off between overall variance and price jumps when designing optimal tax. •We study an artificial financial market using an agent-based model and Monte Carlo.•We study the impact of the financial transaction tax (FTT) on the price process.•We focus on overall volatility and distinguish Gaussian noise from price jumps.•Imposing FTT increases overall volatility together with rate of price jumps.•The impact of FTT is non-linear."

This paper presents an approach for designers and engineers to quantify the social and environmental impacts of a product at a population level and then perform a trade-off analysis between those impacts. In this approach, designers and engineers define the attributes of the product as well as the materials and processes used in the product’s life cycle. Agent-based modeling (ABM) tools that have been developed to model the social impacts of products are combined with life cycle assessment (LCA) tools that have been developed to evaluate the pressures that different processes create on the environment. Designers and engineers then evaluate the trade-offs between impacts by finding non-dominated solutions that minimize environmental impacts while maximizing positive and/or minimizing negative social impacts. Product adoption models generated by ABM allow designers and engineers to approximate population level environmental impacts and avoid Simpson’s paradox, where a reversal in choices is preferred when looking at the population level impacts versus the individual product-level impacts. This analysis of impacts has the potential to help designers and engineers create more impactful products that aid in reaching the UN sustainable development goals."

With the goal to facilitate urban policy makers to draw up policies locally and optimise the land use assignment in order to support the development of creative industries, the improved model exhibited its capacity to assist the policy makers conducting experiments and simulating different policy scenarios to see the corresponding dynamics of the spatial distributions of creative firms and creative workers across time within a city/district. The spatiotemporal graphs and maps record the simulation results and can be used as a reference by the policy makers to adjust land use plans adaptively at different stages of the creative industries’ development process."

Despite their prevalence, the decision to provide introductory prices to new customers entails challenges for decision makers. Providing small incentives may not perceptibly affect the adoption of the service while providing a large incentive leads to the loss of revenue and profits. As a result, the effectiveness of such activities on firm profitability remains largely unexplored. This study seeks to address this gap in the literature by exploring optimal introductory pricing of a financial service. Employing agent-based simulation experiments, we find that offering introductory discounts significantly increases a firm’s net present value (NPV) of profits. Moreover, the findings suggest the amount of discount and the duration of time that a new customer receives the discount are critical factors in determining the NPV of profits. The research and managerial implications are discussed."

Consumers choose between these products based on consumer reviews and their own experience. We examine how the market share of the superior product is affected by (i) the number of reviews obtained by consumers; and (ii) the type of information conveyed in these reviews. We find that when consumers randomly sample reviews from the entire population, an increase in the number of reviews can decrease the market share of the superior product. This, however, is not the case when consumers seek out reviews on each product. Further, we find that the market share of the superior product can be significantly lower when reviews convey subjective satisfaction compared to when they convey objective payoffs. This effect depends on the degree of heterogeneity in consumer expectations."

We attempt to evaluate the performance of these designs on the bases of trade volume, cost efficiency and stability. To achieve this we construct an empirically-calibrated but simple agent-based model, certain aspects of which we selectively modify to incorporate various design options. We make comparisons among these options based on data simulated from the ensuing family of models. We find strong evidence that in general, market design features such as source-of-credits, the scale of the market, and pricing-mechanism are very important considerations that influence the performance of the market. In addition, we find support for the notion that the level of the price cap relative to the average cost of abatement in the market matters, and beyond a threshold, higher price caps are associated with lower levels of performance."

We describe an ecological- economic land-use change model as an integrated, exploratory tool used to analyze how tropical land-use change affects ecological and socio-economic functions. The model analysis seeks to determine what kind of landscape mosaic can improve the ensemble of ecosystem functioning, biodiversity, and economic benefit based on the synergies and trade-offs that we have to account for. More specifically, (1) how do specific ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage, and economic functions, such as household consumption, relate to each other? (2) How do external factors, such as the output prices of crops, affect these relationships? (3) How do these relationships change when production inefficiency differs between smallholder farmers and learning is incorporated? We initialize the ecological-economic model with artificially generated land-use maps parameterized to our study region. The economic sub-model simulates smallholder land-use management decisions based on a profit maximization assumption. Each household determines factor inputs for all household fields and decides on land-use change based on available wealth. The ecological sub-model includes a simple account of carbon sequestration in above-ground and below-ground vegetation. We demonstrate model capabilities with results on household consumption and carbon sequestration from different output price and farming efficiency scenarios. The overall results reveal complex interactions between the economic and ecological spheres. For instance, model scenarios with heterogeneous crop-specific household productivity reveal a comparatively high inertia of land-use change. Our model analysis even shows such an increased temporal stability in landscape composition and carbon stocks of the agricultural area under dynamic price trends. These findings underline the utility of ecological- economic models, such as ours, to act as exploratory tools which can advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the trade-offs and synergies of ecological and economic functions in tropical landscapes."

Several SCs, such as in the energy, food, chemical, and forestry areas, are highly regulated. Explicitly modelling the actors involved in the regulation of SCs using normative agents allowed us to evaluate the potential benefits of alternative strategies for planning of regulated SCs. The modelling of a biodiesel SC is presented as a case study."

Neo-classical economic theory suggests that globalised free trade is the most efficient way of handling these demands, allowing maximum productivity and specialisation of supply. However, political responses are often protectionist in nature, designed to ensure continuity of land uses and the regional production of multiple services. We investigate the implications of both globalisation and regionalisation of demand for the efficiency and productivity of land uses and, using an agent-based model of land use change, how realistic forms of human behaviour can strengthen, weaken or alter these implications. We show that rational productive agents tend towards optimal land use configurations under globalised systems, but that ‘irrational’ behaviour yields superior results under regionalisation. Finally, the adoption of multifunctional land uses is found to be a strong and effective emergent property of agent populations under regional demand."

Examples of such innovations are fax machines, e-mail, cellular phones, and software programs such as word processors. The success of these innovations requires a minimum number of adopters.Design methodology approach - The paper uses agent-based modeling and simulation.Findings - The relationship between price and net present value (NPV) of revenue resembles an asymmetric inverse U-shape. A low-pricing strategy outperforms high-pricing, while a moderate-pricing strategy outperforms both low- and high-pricing strategies. Moreover, heterogeneity of consumer price sensitivity positively affects the NPV of sales.Practical implications - Pricing durable new products with network externalities is more challenging than other types of innovations. The results indicate that firms can maximize their NPV by adopting a moderate pricing strategy. Moreover, firms must consider heterogeneity of consumer price sensitivity along with the market price elasticity when making pricing decisions. Detailed strategic implications and recommendations are discussed.Originality value - Several recent studies have called for examining pricing strategies for new products with network externalities. The study findings challenge the common wisdom that a penetration pricing strategy is an optimal approach for durable products with network externalities. Moreover, while other studies have highlighted the importance of market price elasticity, extensive simulation experiments conducted in this study show that heterogeneity of consumer price sensitivity is an important factor that must be considered. Finally, the study presents an agent-based modeling approach for exploring optimal pricing of innovations with network externalities."

Examples are abundant in the worldwide markets for insurance, credit products and transaction processing services. A question of growing interest is how firms should price these innovations. The optimal introductory pricing of financial innovations may vary as a function of factors such as price sensitivity of the market and competitors’ ability to introduce competing financial solutions. In this article, we examine the role of these factors in the optimal pricing of a financial innovation. Using an agent-based simulation framework, introductory pricing strategies that maximize profitability under various market conditions are identified. Results indicate that lower levels of market price sensitivity and longer time horizons for competitive entry create pricing opportunities for financial innovators. However, the relationship becomes more complex as market price sensitivity increases or competitive market entry becomes more immediate. Detailed recommendations for optimal pricing of financial innovations under various market conditions are provided, and the article concludes with strategic recommendations for pricing innovative financial services."

These statistical tools are based on modelling agents trading via a centralised order book, in order to emulate complex and diverse market phenomena. These past financial models have all relied on so-called zero-intelligence agents, so that the crucial issues of agent information and learning, central to price formation and hence to all market activity, could not be properly assessed. In order to address this, we designed a next-generation MAS stock market simulator, in which each agent learns to trade autonomously via reinforcement learning. We calibrate the model to real market data from the London Stock Exchange over the years 2007 to 2018, and show that it can faithfully reproduce key market microstructure metrics, such as various price autocorrelation scalars over multiple time intervals. Agent learning thus enables accurate emulation of the market microstructure as an emergent property of the MAS."

However, research has not yet systematically and sufficiently considered the spatial dimension of ESS trade-offs as a source of conflicts. Moreover, approaches for ESS management that address a wide range of beneficiaries and their interactions at landscape scale are lacking. Our main research question is how to motivate different beneficiaries of agricultural landscapes to cooperate in reducing supply-demand mismatches and accompanied conflicts, as well as to assess how different scenarios would impact relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We present a novel and conceptual integrated model in which we employ a combination of three methodological tools: participatory geographic information system (PGIS), agent-based modelling (ABM) and a Bayesian belief network (BBN). The objective of our model simulation is to identify and manage site-specific spatial trade-off patterns and to provide decision support for shifting competitive behavior of individual stakeholders in satisfying their demand for ESS to a collective and cooperative scheme, while jointly striving to attain relevant targets outlined in the SDGs. Attached to this work is a short video depicting our conceptual model. We strongly suggest that tackling a complex social-ecological system necessitates a highly integrated modelling approach that fosters the transition from farm- to landscape-scale management, from individualistic to collective action, and from competitive to cooperative behavior."

Design/methodology/approach Using an agent-based computational simulation, this research models different simulated employees working together in “ad hoc” teams to solve problems. Findings Results show that inquisitiveness may work as an efficiency “driver” that, when present, economizes on the knowledge needed by team members to solve problems. In addition to that, results also show that environments with many problems are more suitable for inquisitive individuals to be effective. Originality/value Following the late Herbert Simon, the paper takes the stance that rationality should be redefined as a socially oriented process and introduces inquisitiveness as one – although probably not the only one – of the characteristics that help individuals and teams to make rational decisions."

This paper shows how an approach from Complexity Science, exploratory agent-based modeling (ABM), can be used to study the impact of two different modes of use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) on organizational culture (OC) and performance. The ABM includes stylized representations of (a) agents communicating with other agents to complete tasks; (b) an OC consisting of the distribution of agent traits, changing as agents communicate; (c) the effect of OC on communication effectiveness (CE), and (d) the effect of CE on task completion times, that is, performance. If CMC is used in a broad mode, that is, to contact and collaborate with many, new agents, the development of a strong OC is slowed, leading to decreased CE and poorer performance early on. If CMC is used in a local mode, repeatedly contacting the same agents, a strong OC develops rapidly, leading to increased CE and high performance early on. However, if CMC is used in a broad mode over longer time periods, a strong OC can develop over a wider set of agents, leading to an OC that is stronger than an OC which develops with local CMC use. Thus broad use of CMC results in overall CE and performance that is higher than is generated by local use of CMC. We also discuss how the dynamics generated by an ABM can lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of a CAS, for example, allowing us to better design empirical longitudinal studies."

The present study develops a new model based on Mathematical Programming-based Multi-Agent System (MPMAS), a simulation software that allows assessing ex-ante the impact of alternative pesticide use reduction strategies, including combinations of pesticide taxes, the introduction of integrated pest management, a price premium for safe agricultural produce, and subsidies for biopesticides. The model is parameterized with farm and plot level data from northern of Thailand, where the adoption of high-value cash crops has been accompanied by a rapid increase in synthetic pesticide use. Simulation results suggest that a pesticide tax alone has little effect on synthetic pesticide use. A smart policy package – combining integrated pest management, a progressive pesticide tax based on toxicity and subsidies lowering the price of biopesticides – can reduce average use of hazardous pesticides by 34% over current levels without adverse effects on the average farm income."
WilliamsBrett2022EotC,,Essays on the Continuous Double Auction in General Equilibrium,"Williams, Brett",2022,,,,,,,"eScholarship, University of California",,"The continuous double auction (CDA) has found itself in a state of ubiquity in today's market landscape. Such presence has motivated a vast literature on the double auction, spanning theoretical, experimental and empirical works alike. Despite the century or so of research into the underpinnings of the double auction and its many variations, much is left to discover in terms of convergence and its determinants. This dissertation investigates the driving forces of the continuous double auction institution, as well as mechanisms for equilibrium-achieving trader behavior, all set in simple general equilibrium settings. Chapter 1 presents a model of zero intelligence trading in the continuous double auction, though set in a general equilibrium economy and unconstrained to the point of reaching a lower level of `zero' than prior literature. Much like Gode and Sunder (1993), the model's intent is not to give a prescription for what traders do in the world, but to better understand the driving power and mechanisms underlying the CDA in a more complex environment. To fully understand the implications of the model, the institution and the economic setting, I simulate several variations of the market hundreds of times. Chapter 2 pushes further into the wilderness of bounded rationality, questioning how price accessibility in a CDA impacts trader behavior. Do they respond to orders being posted and traders being made, and if so, how? To investigate, I run a set of laboratory experiments which vary the accessibility of prices in the orderbook and transaction history. I pair the experiment with another general equilibrium adaptation of a classic CDA agent-based model (Gjerstad and Dickhaut (1998)), one which assumes traders perfectly choose orders based on their beliefs on how acceptable prices are. Chapter 3 postulates a trader behavior model which is able to encapsulate the models of Chapter 1 and 2, and also provide one mapping of the intermediate levels of minimal intelligence between them. In addition to holding beliefs on prices, traders also abide by reservations that allow for disequilibrium trade, and select orders imperfectly via logit choice."

Past agent-based simulations simplistically use an equally-spaced grid structure for the layout of the properties. This simple spacing does not reflect the actual size and dispersion of properties. Instead, we use GIS models of actual neighborhoods to study the impact of size and spacing within a real estate agent-based simulation to investigate the foreclosure contagion effect. The topologies of five neighborhoods in Virginia Beach, Virginia were uploaded into an agent-based simulation using publicly accessible GIS data. The results indicate that non-linear pricing changes occur within the neighborhoods. Moreover, the density of a neighborhood is a significant determining factor in explaining differential results."

We use agent based models and best response behaviors of agents to study our questions of interest. In general, we find that allowing agents to move and choose new game play partners greatly increases the probability of attaining the Pareto dominant Nash equilibrium in coordination games. We also find that agent diversity increases the ability of agents to attain larger payoffs on average."

We develop an approach to analyzing simulation results that makes use of nonparametric statistical tests, taking advantage of the large amounts of data generated by simulations, and avoiding the assumption of normality that does not necessarily hold. Our results show that in a quantity game, a simple exploration rule, which we call Probe and Adjust , can find either the Cournot equilibrium or the monopoly solution depending on the measure of success chosen by the firms. These results shed light on how tacit collusion can develop within an oligopoly."

The standards literature suggests that strong network effects create a bias toward a standard with a large installed base, leading to a winner-take-all outcome. More recently, several researchers have revealed that the dynamics of standardization are much more complex than the explanation offered by the economic theory of networks. Markets do not always exhibit tipping behavior so there is not always a single winner in de facto standardization; and the size of an overall installed base does not always exert a strong influence on adoption decisions. In contrast, network effects drawn from local social influence may be more salient to user adoption decisions. We ask: (1) Do we always observe a winner-take-all outcome in de facto standards competition? (2) What are the different technology adoption patterns observed in de facto standards competition? (3) What are the implications of network effects, switching costs, pricing, and functionality enhancement strategies on the outcome of de facto standards competition in different user network structures? Drawing on the economic theory of networks, the complex network theory, and previous work in the standards literature, we examine the influence of network effects, switching costs, price, and technology functionality on user adoption decisions using agent-based simulation. We incorporate underlying user network structures frequently observed in the real world as an important determining factor of user adoption decisions. Our results suggest that de facto standardization process does not always follow a three-phased S-shaped pattern. Winner-take-all is not a necessary outcome of standards competition. User network structures have a significant impact on the dynamics and outcomes of standards competition."

However, a proper characterization of price impacts is still lacking. This study models the price impact using an agent-based modeling approach. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether agent intelligence is a necessary condition when seeking to construct realistic price impact with an artificial market simulation. We build a zero-intelligence based artificial limit order market model. Our model distinguishes limit orders according to their order aggressiveness and takes into account some observed facts including log-normal distributed order sizes and power-law distributed limit order placements. The model is calibrated using trades and orders data from the London Stock Exchange. The results indicate that agent intelligence is needed when simulating an artificial market where replicating price impact is a concern."
FalconerRE2020ADof,,Anaerobic Digestion of food waste: Eliciting sustainable water-energy-food nexus practices with Agent Based Modelling and visual analytics,"Falconer, RE and Haltas, I and Varga, L and Forbes, PJ and Abdel-Aal, M and Panayotov, N",2020,,,,,,,,,"Food waste is a problem for which solutions are recognised but not readily put into practice. What should be the primary objective, reducing or eliminating surplus food production, requires great change within social, cultural and economic structures. The secondary approach of redistributing surplus food to areas of deficit (in terms of socio-economic groups and/or geographic regions) involves a significant logistical burden, and suffers the same issues as with the elimination of waste. The least desirable, but perhaps most practicable approach, is the use of food waste as a feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion (AD). The strategic adoption of AD can therefore be seen as an important step towards mitigating food waste, but the implementation of efficient AD systems on a large (county/region) scale involves significant complexity. The optimal number, size and location of AD plants, and whether they are centralised versus decentralised, may be determined by considering factors such as supply and proximity to feedstock, transport links, emission hazards and social impact. Reaching balanced and objective decisions when faced with such disparate criteria is inevitably very difficult. To address this problem we prototype and evaluate a decision support tool for county-scale AD planning. Our approach is a hybridised Agent Based Model (ABM) with a Multi Objective Optimisation. We capture the spatio-temporal dependencies that exist in the water, energy and food systems associated with energy derived from food waste using Agent Based Modelling (ABM). The use of Interactive Multi Criteria Analysis as visual analytics offers a means to communicate the co-benefits and trade-offs that may emerge, as well as prioritise the AD strategies, based on the prioritization of criteria. Specifically, the method supports exploration of the social, environmental and economic impact of different AD strategies and decisions, linked to current issues, namely AD scale and adoption. The results highlight a trade-off between transport costs and social acceptability for the AD centralised versus decentralised strategies. When low carbon options are weighted higher then slow, steady and aggressive decentralised strategies are the best strategic adoption of AD. Conversely, when Energy production is considered a priority, then aggressive scaling up in a centralised approach is best with slow and steady approaches being further from the ideal. The framework has demonstrated that it permits a space for dialogue and transparent prioritization of AD strategies based on WEF nexus impacts."

In this paper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both fundamental and technical traders. This is based on a trade arrival model with variable size orders and a general arrival-time distribution. With simplifications we are led in the jump-free case to a local volatility model defined by a hybrid SDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric or CIR Brownian motions, whose solution in the geometric case is given by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against another, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the hybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered by Nagahara, which is a type of 'Pearson diffusion', or, equivalently, a hyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on the balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally at an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type~IV form. Under less-restrictive assumptions, richer dynamics are possible, including time-dependent Johnson-SU distributions and bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is identified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a priori been expected, so that '25σ' events are significantly more probable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation that shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian facade. These are elementary members of an extended class of distributions with a rich and varied structure, capable of describing a wide range of market behaviors. Several approaches to the density function are possible, and an example of the computation of a hyperbolic VaR is given. The model also suggests generalizations of the Bougerol identity. We touch briefly on the extent to which such a model is consistent with the dynamics of a 'flash-crash' event, and briefly explore the statistical evidence for our model."

In particular, it is found that the classic modelling techniques fail to sufficiently represent these decision processes. This paper examines the potentials of an agent-based approach for the locational choices of consumers for their shopping activities on a regional level. The model is applied to two product sectors, groceries and clothing, in two distinct research areas in northern Sweden and southern Germany. While the empirical findings generated for the two case studies resulted in quite different model designs, both are found to be equally applicable for representing the different choice mechanisms and result in forecasts of buying power flows and thus turnovers of individual shops. It is concluded that agent-based approaches provide an elaborate instrument to model consumer locational choices and to forecast consequences of planning decisions, although expanding the empirical basis on qualitative grounds of research may lead to still further advancements. Die Forschungen der letzten Jahre zeigte, dass Konsumstile und -gewohnheiten sich immer weiter ausdifferenzieren. Dies hat zur Konsequenz, dass Entscheidungen der Verbraucher immer schwerer für die Forschung und Modellierung fassbar werden. Insbesondere ist festzustellen, dass die klassischen Modellierungstechniken bei der Darstellung dieser Entscheidungsprozesse an ihre Grenzen stoßen. Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Potenziale eines agentenbasierten Ansatzes zur Modellierung der Einkaufsstättenwahl auf einer regionalen Ebene. Das Modell wird in zwei verschiedenen Untersuchungsräumen (in Nordschweden und im südlichen Deutschland) auf zwei Produktbereiche, Lebensmittel und Kleidung, angewendet. Obwohl die empirischen Befunde zu den beiden Fallstudien zu verschiedenen Modell-Designs führten, können beide Modelle gleichermaßen eingesetzt werden, um nicht nur die Einkaufsstättenwahl von Individuen darzustellen, sondern auch Abschätzungen von Kaufkraftströmen und Umsatzschätzungen einzelner Geschäfte vorzunehmen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen auch, dass agentenbasierte Ansätze ein sehr gut geeignetes Instrumentarium bieten, um nicht nur das Handeln und Verhalten von Akteuren zu modellieren, sondern auch um Folgen von Planungsentscheidungen zu simulieren. Potenziale bestehen jedoch noch in der Einbindung qualitativer empirischer Ergebnisse in die Modelle."

Two standard pricing rules are considered and compared (i.e., “discriminatory” and “uniform”) and computational experiments, characterized by different inelastic demand level, explore oligopolistic competitions on both quantity and price between learning sellers/producers. Two reinforcement learning algorithms are considered as well—“Marimon and McGrattan” and “Q-learning”—in an attempt to simulate different behavioral types. In particular, greedy sellers (optimizing their instantaneous rewards on a tick-by-tick basis) and inter-temporal optimizing sellers are simulated. Results are interpreted relative to game-theoretical solutions and performance metrics. Nash equilibria in pure strategies and sellers’ joint profit maximization are employed to analyze the convergence behavior of the learning algorithms. Furthermore, the difference between payments to suppliers and total generation costs are estimated so as to measure the degree of market inefficiency. Results point out that collusive behaviors are penalized by the discriminatory auction mechanism in low demand scenarios, whereas in a high demand scenario the difference appears to be negligible."

We studied simulated interventions that leveraged social networks to increase physical activity in children. Methods. We studied a real-world social network of 81 children (average age = 7.96 years) who lived in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods, and attended public schools and 1 of 2 structured afterschool programs. The sample was ethnically diverse, and 44% were overweight or obese. We used social network analysis and agent-based modeling simulations to test whether implementing a network intervention would increase children's physical activity. We tested 3 intervention strategies. Results. The intervention that targeted opinion leaders was effective in increasing the average level of physical activity across the entire network. However, the intervention that targeted the most sedentary children was the best at increasing their physical activity levels. Conclusions. Which network intervention to implement depends on whether the goal is to shift the entire distribution of physical activity or to influence those most adversely affected by low physical activity. Agent-based modeling could be an important complement to traditional project planning tools, analogous to sample size and power analyses, to help researchers design more effective interventions for increasing children's physical activity."

Doyne and Hepburn, Cameron and Mealy, Penny and Teytelboym, Alexander",2015,Environmental & resource economics,62,2,329-357,,,Springer Netherlands,Dordrecht,"Modelling the economics of climate change is daunting. Many existing methodologies from social and physical sciences need to be deployed, and new modelling techniques and ideas still need to be developed. Existing bread-and-butter micro- and macroeconomic tools, such as the expected utility framework, market equilibrium concepts and representative agent assumptions, are far from adequate. Four key issues—along with several others—remain inadequately addressed by economic models of climate change, namely: (1) uncertainty, (2) aggregation, heterogeneity and distributional implications (3) technological change, and most of all, (4) realistic damage functions for the economic impact of the physical consequences of climate change. This paper assesses the main shortcomings of two generations of climate-energy-economic models and proposes that a new wave of models need to be developed to tackle these four challenges. This paper then examines two potential candidate approaches—dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models and agent-based models (ABM). The successful use of agent-based models in other areas, such as in modelling the financial system, housing markets and technological progress suggests its potential applicability to better modelling the economics of climate change."

Here we analyze the trade-off between irrigation and fisheries in the Amudarya, a semi-arid river basin in Central Asia, using an optimal control and an agent-based modeling approach. With the optimal control approach (OCA), we identify the economic and ecological conditions for water sharing in a regime where a social manager controls water withdrawals and fish harvesting. With the agent-based model (ABM), we relax some of the assumptions of the OCA to investigate how localized, individual agents with varied water use histories adapt their water use activities to local resource conditions. Variation in the farmers' initial labor allocations to the two activities results in regimes with only one activity or both. Global returns and income equality are highest in a mixed regime. The mixed regimes also are more robust to water variability because fishing activities can compensate for decreased agricultural performance in the midstream regions. Thus, allowing for multiple uses can improve the coupled social-ecological system's performance and its resilience. We also observe a lock-in effect similar to the current situation in the Amudarya, where agriculture is the dominant water use and transition to a more balanced allocation has proven to be extremely difficult. As in the ABM, this can to some extent be attributed to the difficulties of achieving sufficient revenues from fishing when agricultural activities upstream are high. Regulations or incentives are needed to overcome those barriers, and to facilitate progress towards integrated water management."
HailuAtakelty2010WFfM,,What Format for Multi-Unit Multiple-Bid Auctions?: Agent-Based Simulation of Auction Performance and Nonlinear Bidding Behaviour,"Hailu, Atakelty and Thoyer, Sophie",2010,Computational economics,35,3,189-209,,,Springer US,Boston,"This paper uses computational experiments where bidders learn over nonlinear bidding strategies to compare outcomes for alternative pricing format for multi-unit multiple-bid auctions. Multi-unit multiple-bid auctions, in which bidders are allowed to submit multiple price-quantity bids, are promising mechanisms for the allocation of a range of resources. The main advantage of such auctions is to avoid the lumpy bid problem which arises when bidders can only compete on the basis of one bid. However, there is great uncertainty about the best auction formats when multi-unit auctions are used. The theory can only supply the expected structural properties of equilibrium strategies and the multiplicity of potential equilibria makes comparisons across auction formats difficult. Empirical studies and experiments have improved our knowledge of multi-unit auctions but they remain scarce and most experiments are restricted to two bidders and two units. Moreover, they demonstrate that bidders have limited rationality and learn through experience. This paper constructs an agent-based computational model of bidders to compare the performance of alternative procurement auction formats under circumstances where bidders submit continuous bid supply functions and learn over time to adjust their bids in order to improve their net incomes. The setting is for independent private values. We show that bidding behaviour displays more interesting patterns than is depicted in the theoretical literature and that bidding patterns depend on the interplay between heterogeneity in the bidder population and the degree of rationing in the auction. Results indicate that the three auction formats have similar performance for most levels of competition but that their performances differ when competition is weak. This ranking is dependent on whether the population of bidders is homogenous or heterogeneous."

To ‘see’ why seemingly rational behaviour at the level of an individual FI contributes to system-wide instability is a non-trivial exercise, which requires holistic visualization and modelling techniques. Paradox of volatility inherent to market price-based measures of systemic risk has made bilateral balance sheet and off balance data between FIs and network analysis essential for systemic risk management. There is both a data and a skills gap in implementing large-scale data-driven multi-agent financial network models that can operationalize macro-prudential policy. Different designs for a Pigou-type systemic risk surcharge are discussed with special reference to the Markose eigen-pair method, which simultaneously determines the degree of instability of the network of financial flows of obligors and also the rank order in the centrality of FIs contributing to it."

However, problematic assumptions of rationality remain common in studies of agricultural economics and climate change adaptation, especially those that involve quantitative models. Recent movement toward more complex agent‐based modeling provides an opportunity to reconsider the empirical basis for farmer decision making. Here, we reconceptualize farmer decision making from the ground up, using an in situ mental models approach to analyze weather and climate risk management. We assess how large‐scale commercial grain farmers in South Africa (n = 90) coordinate decisions about weather, climate variability, and climate change with those around other environmental, agronomic, economic, political, and personal risks that they manage every day. Contrary to common simplifying assumptions, we show that these farmers tend to satisfice rather than optimize as they face intractable and multifaceted uncertainty; they make imperfect use of limited information; they are differently averse to different risks; they make decisions on multiple time horizons; they are cautious in responding to changing conditions; and their diverse risk perceptions contribute to important differences in individual behaviors. We find that they use two important nonoptimizing strategies, which we call cognitive thresholds and hazy hedging, to make practical decisions under pervasive uncertainty. These strategies, evident in farmers' simultaneous use of conservation agriculture and livestock to manage weather risks, are the messy in situ performance of naturalistic decision‐making techniques. These results may inform continued research on such behavioral tendencies in narrower lab‐ and modeling‐based studies."

The model progressively adds extensions to a growing network by choosing the most attractive investments from a limited choice set. Attractiveness is defined as a function of variables in which revenue and broader societal benefits may play a role and can be based on empirically underpinned parameters that may differ according to private or public interests. The choice set is selected from an exhaustive set of links and presumably contains those investment options that best meet private operator’s objectives by balancing the revenues of additional fare against construction costs. The investment options consist of geographically plausible routes with potential detours. These routes are generated using a fine-meshed regularly latticed network and shortest path finding methods. Additionally, two indicators of the geographic accuracy of the simulated networks are introduced. A historical case study is presented to demonstrate the model’s first results. These results show that the modelled networks reproduce relevant results of the historically built network with reasonable accuracy."

Our results show that while many interventions are ineffective with a sophisticated platform actor, we identify a particular kind of regulation—fixing fees to the optimal, no-shock fees while still allowing a platform to choose how to match buyers and sellers—as holding promise for promoting the efficiency and resilience of the economic system."
NamDaisik2019MaOo,,Modelling and Optimization of Smart Mobility Systems with Agent Envy as a Paradigm for Fairness and Behavior,"Nam, Daisik",2019,,,,,,,"eScholarship, University of California",,"Smart Urban Mobility in the future demands a paradigm shift. Transportation supply needs to be designed to incorporate individual-level preferences in an era of readily-available information about other users and network performance. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that an individual would have information to compare his/her transportation allocation with other users. For individuals having the same goal (e.g., the shortest path to the destination from the same departure location and time), the peer to peer comparison may induce ‘envy’ if the user perceives his/her assigned travel option to be worse than that of his/her peers.In turn, a user may adjust his/her travel options until he/she does not feel envy. This concept is an extension of the well-known travel behavior assumption called “User Equilibrium”. Existing behavior models, however, do not allow users to compare their allocations with others on an individual basis. Furthermore, it is assumed that users have perfect information about their own alternative and all users are homogeneous. A smart mobility system of the future may also include users who are not human but machines such as logistics, an autonomous vehicle that may have programmed behavior, and thus they too can be considered “agents” in our analysis.This dissertation is dedicated to modeling a smart mobility system which accounts for individual level of allocation. Mobility systems that include connected, autonomous, and subscribed components to various extents will all qualify as smart systems in this context. More specifically, we focus on the optimization of the allocation problem to achieve both system-wide efficiency and minimum envy among individuals. We consider envy to be an important allocation aspect in the transportation system. Maximizing the efficiency of a system necessarily brings about some level of unfairness where some users (or agents) are allocated to inferior alternatives. When agents having superior alternatives can compensate the envy of groups having inferior alternatives, an envy-free state can be achieved—which can be shown to be Pareto efficient state. Using a combination of pricing and incentives, we propose an optimization model to arrive at this new equilibrium.This research has significant contributions in that the proposed model provides a framework to combine system-wide objectives with individual users’ utility objectives. Furthermore, we consider user heterogeneity, which has not been researched in the general area of transportation assignment. The proposed optimization model can be applied to pricing strategies both for commercial and public agencies, who have real-time information about customer characteristics and system performance.Numerical results from running our optimization on both illustrative and real networks show that the proposed model converges to both envy-free and system optimum states with appropriate allocation and pricing schemes. Our findings show that the proposed smart mobility system technically works efficiently without governmental subsidy since the budget-balance mechanism trades off credits among users. In addition, the level of user heterogeneity affects the amount of credits charged or disbursed."

Entonces, las expectativas semiadaptativas son integradas en un modelo macroeconómico multiagentes para ilustrar su impacto en la fragilidad financiera de las empresas. Entre los resultados obtenidos, se evidencia que las empresas pueden limitar la magnitud de su fragilidad financiera si formulan sus expectativas de ingresos con un grado máximo de volatilidad alrededor de una expectativa inicial que sirve de casi referencia de largo plazo."
FosterJohn2011Emar,,Evolutionary macroeconomics: a research agenda,"Foster, John",2011,Journal of evolutionary economics,21,1,28-May,,,Berlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlag,Berlin/Heidelberg,"In this article, the goal is to offer a new research agenda for evolutionary macroeconomics. The article commences with a broad review of the main ideas in the history of thought concerning the determinants of economic growth and an introduction to the evolutionary perspective. This is followed by a selective review of recent evolutionary approaches to macroeconomics. These approaches are found to be somewhat disconnected. It is argued that the ‘micro-meso-macro' approach to economic evolution is capable of resolving this problem by offering an analytical framework in which macroeconomics can be built upon ‘meso-foundations', not micro-foundations, as asserted in the mainstream. It is also stressed that the economic system and its components are complex adaptive systems and that this complexity must not be assumed away through the imposition of simplistic assumptions made for analytical convenience. It is explained that complex economic systems are, at base, energetic in character but differ from biological complex systems in the way that they collect, store and apply knowledge. It is argued that a focus upon stocks and flows of energy and knowledge in complex economic systems can yield an appropriate analytical framework for macroeconomics. It is explained how such a framework can be connected with key insights of both Schumpeter and Keynes that have been eliminated in modern macroeconomics. A macroeconomic framework that cannot be operationalized empirically is of limited usefulness so, in the last part of the article, an appropriate methodology for evolutionary macroeconomics is discussed."

This study seeks to contribute to the literature by investigating how the emergence and strength of organizational identification is affected by four variables: duration of primacy; duration of recency; frequency of interaction with other members of the organization; and frequency of information received about the organization.Design methodology approach - Using a cognitive model of organizational identification grounded in memory, agent-based modeling and NetLogo language were employed to form a model in which two groups of 567 contingent workers joined 1,134 different organizations and worked for 365 days. Correlation and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data.Findings - Evolution of organizational identification for a contingent worker depends on how much the individual interacts with other members of the organization and how much information about the organization that particular individual receives over time.Research limitations implications - The generalizability of the simulation study's findings may be expanded if similar studies are carried out incorporating factors that mark differences in individuals, groups, organizations, sectors, industries, cultures, and geographies.Originality value - The existing literature on how contingent employees identify with an organization does not adequately provide a process-based view of the phenomenon. This study extends and complements literature on contingent workers by emphasizing the social construction of time in and from memory throughout the process of organizational identification."

Recently, new models, combining knowledge and tools from biophysical and socio-economic sciences, have become available. This has resulted in spatially explicit models focussed on patterns of change as well as agent-based models focused on the underlying decision processes. These developments improve the use of land use change models in environmental impact studies. This special issue documents these developments: (i) analysing the system properties in a biophysical and socio-economic context at multiple scales; (ii) integrating spatially explicit land use change models in integrated assessment models; (iii) visualising and quantifying the potential effects of land use change in trade-off curves, to support land users and policy makers in their decisions; and (iv) modelling of the actual decision making process with agent-based modelling. A new promising future development is the incorporation of dynamic feedbacks between changing land use and changing environmental conditions and vice versa. Unfortunately such dynamic feedbacks between the socio-economic and biophysical model components are still not or only partially operational in current models and are therefore the most important challenge for land use and environmental modellers."

B.",2009,,2,,20-27,,,IEEE Computer Society,"Washington, DC, USA","This paper describes our experience in building an evolutionary system for agent-based modeling of a financial market. The system uses a type of BDI agents, which are deliberative agents with a mental state defined by a belief base and by a set of desire-generation rules. Beliefs are fuzzy and trust in information sources is taken into account. At any moment, an agent generates a set of desires and selects a consistent subset thereof, whose elements are adopted as goals, to be achieved by executing actions. The market structure is realistic, albeit simplified: a single \emph{asset} is assumed to exist, that is traded on the market in indistinguishable, standardized contracts against payment of \emph{money}. The price of trades is continuously determined by means of a single-price auction, which crosses buy and sell orders to maximize market liquidity. Every agent has, at any moment, an available amount of money and an inventory of asset contracts, which, valued at market price and added to the available money, yields the agent's \emph{net asset value} (NAV). To determine their economical behavior, the agents have access to a set of technical indicators made available by the market, which constitute the sources of their beliefs, and to their current balance, which constitutes their knowledge. The agents participating in the market evolve by means of an evolutionary algorithm: they undergo selection based on their NAV, replication with random mutations, and recombination. When an agent replicates, its properties are divided among the offspring. This evolutionary process favors the reproduction of profitable traders, allowing the emergence of ``sensible'' behaviors. The market thus simulated has been analyzed both in quantitative and in qualitative terms. The analysis has demonstrated that the model exhibits several traits that are typical of real-world financial markets."

The ascending-bid, second-price auction is the most widely used e-auction format. The aim of this study is to present a dynamic model of an e-auction so as to investigate how the welfare of buyers is affected by different ascending-bid types. This problem has been studied theoretically in economics in various static auction mechanisms where perfect rationality of participants is assumed. To overcome the limitations of this approach, the new agent based modeling methodology in which researchers use simulations to investigate the behavior and interactions of autonomous, heterogeneous, bounded rational adaptive population of agents in the social and economical environments, has been emerged. In this paper we adapt the bottom-up agent based modeling methodology to investigate the behavior of participants in electronic markets. On the other hand, since observing the biding strategies of individuals is almost impossible in laboratory or field experiments, we developed a simulation model to understand the welfare effects of different bidding strategies. To some extend sensitivity of the auction outcome on auction rules and market design parameters are also investigated. In our experiments the strategies where the agents update their bid increments in proportion to the differences between their reservation price and current bid are found to be the winning strategies where the duration of the auction is shorter. As the duration of the auction increases all the strategies converged to the same average payoffs."

It is important to address these uncertainties to meet the economic, ecological and social challenges. The retuned products can be remanufactured, have parts harvested, or be disposed safely. It is important to implement these activities in a cost-effective manner. The aim of this paper is to measure the performance of the RL enterprise with the help of Agent-based Modeling technique. The major entities in the RL network are considered as Agents which can act independently. There are several different agents: Collector Agent, Sorting-cum-Reuse Agent, Refurbishing Agent, Recycler Agent, Supplier Agent and Distributor Agent. The individual performances of each agent are measured and recommendations are given to improve their performance, leading to the enhancement of the total performance of the RL enterprise. The solution approach is applied to a case study involving a cell-phone refurbishing/recycling process."

Proceedings,,,1-,,,Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE),Norcross,"This paper adopts an agent-based modeling approach to investigate the problem of trading wind power in the deregulated day-ahead electricity markets with double-sided auction rule and locational marginal price (LMP) mechanism. The scenarios investigated consider the accuracy of short-term wind power forecasts and two wind penetration levels. The agent-based models are built for the double-sided auction market with limited upper price, based on the IEEE 30-bus grid system with constrained transmission capacities. The results demonstrate the economic benefits of adopting learning algorithms in the auction process. The total net earnings of the wind generation company with learning are more than doubled compared with those without learning. Similarly, the average LMPs at the bus of wind generation with learning are almost doubled compared with the cases without learning. It is also found that improving wind power forecasting accuracy can further increase the total net earnings for the wind generation company. In addition, the results indicate that a higher wind penetration level could bring down the LMPs to certain extent. With the wind intermittent production by its nature, the wind generation companies should become more strategic in proposing a proper supply offer by learning from previous auction experience as well as based on reliable wind forecasts.

Indeed, qualitative stylized-facts can be generated with zero-intelligence traders (ZITs) but we stress that they are without any quantitative predictive power. In this paper we show that in most of the cases, such qualitative stylized facts hide unrealistic price motions at the intraday level and ill-calibrated return processes as well. To generate realistic price motions and return series with adequate quantitative values is out-of-reach using pure ZIT populations. To do so, one must increasingly constrain agents’ choices to a point where it is hard to claim that their behaviour is completely random. In addition we show that even with highly constrained ZIT agents, one cannot reproduce real time series from these. Except in a few cases, first order moments of ZITs never equal real data ones. We therefore claim that stylized facts produced by means of ZIT agents are useless for financial engineering."

Logistic-type models offer limited insights regarding the adoption process dynamics or the utility value of their results. The purpose of this paper is to outline an alternative technology adoption framework based on complex adaptive networks. Design/methodology/approach – An agent-based methodological approach is proposed. In it the actors, factors, goals, and adaptive learning influences driving solar energy technology adoption (SETA) process are first substantiated by empirical evidence gathered using field questionnaires and then incorporated in the simulation of a dynamic complex adaptive network of SETA. The complex adaptive network model is based on simple heuristic rules applied using a modified preferential attachment scheme within a NetLogo simulation environment. Findings – The interim results suggest an emergent network where prominent hub “driver” agents underlining the robustness of the model are statistically discernible. Research limitations/implications – The research is limited to solar photovoltaic and solar water heating technology adoption in Botswana households; however, its results are far-reaching. Practical implications – These results can be related to sustainable energy policy design. There, targeted incentive mechanisms can be formulated against the backdrop of the identified environmental factors and actors; the aim being to accelerate and cascade SETA. Social implications – The results could also be cascaded to other sectors and other non-solar technologies, thus providing a general alternative framework for enabling the widespread adoption of technologies. Originality/value – This research therefore represents a novel way of utilizing the new science of networks to accelerate SETA."

Our aim is to briefly introduce a TDR market concept for Switzerland, present an empirically calibrated agent-based TDR market simulation, and finally analyze the detailed simulation results. We ran the simulation with four different settings which allowed an analysis of relevant political and economic questions for Switzerland. The results show that the TDR prices were comparable with existing land prices in Switzerland. In addition, we are able to show that with the trade of TDR it would be possible to downzone 11.4 km(2) of building zone land for which there is no demand and to develop 7.4 km(2) of new building zone land up to the year 2018. Consequently, the defined building zone area would decrease, which would be in line with political objectives."

Evolution operates at the microscopic level; in organizations, this is the individual or agent. Each agent has an idiosyncratic view of the organization, using to some extent personal constructs in dealing with the reality of organizational life. These objects or constructs can be described and measured by most agents; they are well defined. Many of these objects are represented in electronic, IT systems. Each agent also has their own view as to how they know what they know, that is, their epistemology, which we argue is their IS, and is wider than the IT systems they use. The IS of each agent co-evolves, by interaction with other agents, based on the agent's view of reality. The interaction of all agents constitutes the organization. Even more importantly, different values and interests motivate each agent. This is their axiology and it is what motivates them to learn and to develop their IS. An agent-based axiological framework is essential to understanding the evolution of organizations. It is the interaction of agents that builds consensus as to the shared reality of the organization, and this affects each agent's ability and motivation to evolve IS further. In addition, we propose that it is time that IT systems included modelling capabilities, based on multi-agent representations of the organization and its context, to explore and support strategic thinking and decision making."

Proceedings,,,1-,,,Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE),Norcross,"This paper proposes an agent-based model to simulate individual patient's choice of hospitals in a rural area. Hospital bypassing is defined as a phenomenon where patients in rural areas seek their medical services from other regional hospitals due to different qualities of care, practices, and accessibilities. The hospital bypassing rate in rural communities has been found to range from 20% to over 50%, which could bring negative effects to not only rural hospitals, but also the economy of local communities. Therefore, it is important to understand the drivers of patients' hospital preferences and personal attributes to retain patients locally in their own region. In this study, the agent-based modeling approach is applied to allow for patient-environment interactions to be explicitly modeled. Patients' responses to hospital choice and personal attributes are analyzed to indentify agent behavior parameters, such as patient demographics, knowledge, and preferences. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the agent-based approach to understand the underlying mechanism of the hospital bypassing behavior. It can also be used to predict the long-term economic impact on rural hospitals. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

To this end, they are required to improve not only their own environmental and social performance but also the performance of their suppliers. Building on population ecology theory, we explore how buyers' exposure to supplier sustainability risk and their subsequent risk management strategies at the buyer–supplier dyad level can lead to adherence to sustainability by the supplier populations.Design/methodology/approachWe rely on a bottom-up research design, in which the actions of buyers within buyer–supplier dyads lead to population-wide changes on the supplier side. Specifically, we use experimental data on managing sustainability risk to build an agent-based simulation model and assess the effect of evolutionary processes on the presence of sustainable/unsustainable business practices in the supplier population.FindingsOur findings suggest that buyers' cumulative actions in managing sustainability risk do not necessarily result in effective population-wide improvements (i.e. at a high rate and to a high degree). For example, in high risk impact conditions, the buyer population is usually able to decrease the population level risk in a long run, but they would need both power and resources for quickly achieving such improved outcomes. Importantly, this positive change, in most cases, is due to the fact that the buyer population selects out the suppliers with high probability of misconduct (i.e. decreased supplier population density).Originality/valueDrawing on the organizational population ecology theory, we explore when, to what degree and how quickly the buyers' cumulative efforts can lead to population-wide changes in the level of supplier sustainability risk, as well as the composition and density of supplier population. Methodologically, this paper is one of the first studies which use a combination of experimental data and agent-based modeling to offer more valuable insights on supply networks."

Background: Previous analyses of food hub dynamics focused primarily on financial drivers rather than social factors and have not used mathematical models. Method: Based on qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 22 customers and 11 vendors at a midwestern food hub, an agent-based model (ABM) was created with distinct consumer personas characterizing the range of consumer priorities. A comparison study determined if the ABM behaved differently than a model based on traditional economic assumptions. Further simulation studies assessed the effect of changes in parameters, such as producer reliability and the consumer profiles, on long-term food hub sustainability. Results: The persona-based ABM model produced different and more resilient results than the more traditional way of modeling consumers. Reduced producer reliability significantly reduced trade; in some instances, a modest reduction in reliability threatened the sustainability of the system. Finally, a modest increase in price-driven consumers at the outset of the simulation quickly resulted in those consumers becoming a majority of the overall customer base. Conclusion: Results suggest that social factors, such as desire to support the community, can be more important than financial factors. Application: An ABM of food hub dynamics, based on human factors data gathered from the field, can be a useful tool for policy decisions. Similar approaches can be used for modeling customer dynamics with other sustainable organizations."

Despite anticipated overall benefits to society, the transition to a circular economy is likely to create regional differences in impacts. As a result, it is important to evaluate the performance and tradeoffs associated with circular economy transitions. This poster summaries three previously published analytical tools that were used to assess the performance of developing a circular economy for wind energy technologies: the Renewable Energy Materials Properties Database (REMPD), a circular economy agent-based model for wind blades (CE Wind ABM), and the Circular Economy Lifecycle Assessment and Visualization (CELAVI) framework. The REMPD is a comprehensive database of materials used in wind and solar plants, including material quantities and physical materials availability. The CE Wind ABM allows us to understand how wind stakeholders' end-of-life behaviors influence wind blade circularity and evaluate the impact of regional variables (e.g., logistics and transportation). And, the CELAVI framework is a modular framework that can be used to evaluate the impacts associated with circular economy transitions. These three analytical tools have been applied to evaluate circular economy transitions for wind energy technologies and they could be expanded to other technologies and products."

By representing processes as distinct instances of technologies, it is possible to have an infrastructure that self-assembles as each owner of any technology must trade with other owners of technologies to satisfy the individual input and output demands. The ABM is used to generate and simulate the complex bio-electricity system evolution, while an LCA is used to analyze it at each simulation tick by presenting the results of calculating life cycle environmental performance. Thereby, a methodology has been created that allows for a type of dynamic LCA, which provides ecological information for decision-making. Foundations, implementation and application of this new methodology for dynamic LCA will be addressed and themes for further research will be discussed."

A joint analysis of economic and epidemic dynamics under the COVID-19 pandemic,"Basurto, Alessandro and Dawid, Herbert and Harting, Philipp and Hepp, Jasper and Kohlweyer, Dirk",2021,,,,,,,"Bielefeld University, Department of Business Administration and Economics",,"We analyze the impact of different designs of COVID-19 related lockdown policies on economic loss and mortality using a micro-level simulation model, which combines a multisectoral closed economy with an epidemic transmission model. In particular, the model captures explicitly the (stochastic) effect of interactions between heterogeneous agents during different economic activities on virus transmissions. The empirical validity of the model is established using data on economic and pandemic dynamics in Germany in the first six months after the COVID-19 outbreak. We show that a policy inducing switches between a strict lockdown and a full opening-up of economic activity is strictly dominated by alternative policies, which implement either a much more cautious opening at the end of the lockdown or a more or less continuous light lockdown with only minor restrictions of economic activity. Furthermore, also the ex-ante variance of the economic loss suffered during the pandemic is substantially lower under these policies. Keeping the other policy parameters fixed, a variation of the consumption restrictions during the lockdown induces a trade-off between GDP loss and mortality. Finally, we study the robustness of these findings with respect to the occurrence of a more infectious virus mutation."

The study presents results from an agent-based simulation model, which genuinely links bio-physical and socio-economic dynamics, and considers spatial impacts, such as deforestation, hydrological flow and human migration. The results indicate that mining expansions in the upper catchment are likely to trigger larger local income losses in existing livelihoods than income gains from the new employment created. Downstream dynamics are likely to increase flood peaks and lead to increased outmigration. Two system links emerge as key mechanisms for understanding development trade-offs, the link between livelihoods and ecosystem services, and migration, which emphasises the need to apply methodologies that effectively represent these system connections."

OBJECTIVE We propose a method to explore statistical properties of agent-based demographic models. By coupling rule-based explanations driving the agent-based model with observed data we wish to bring agent-based modelling and demographic analysis closer together. METHODS We present a Semi-Artificial Model of Population, which aims to bridge demographic micro-simulation and agent-based traditions. We then utilise a Gaussian process emulator - a statistical model of the base model - to analyse the impact of selected model parameters on two key model outputs: population size and share of married agents. A sensitivity analysis is attempted, aiming to assess the relative importance of different inputs. RESULTS The resulting multi-state model of population dynamics has enhanced predictive capacity as compared to the original specification of the Wedding Ring, but there are some trade-offs between the outputs considered. The sensitivity analysis allows identification of the most important parameters in the modelled marriage formation process. CONCLUSIONS The proposed methods allow for generating coherent, multi-level agent-based scenarios aligned with some aspects of empirical demographic reality. Emulators permit a statistical analysis of their properties and help select plausible parameter values. COMMENTS Given non-linearities in agent-based models such as the Wedding Ring, and the presence of feedback loops, the uncertainty in the model may not be directly computable by using traditional statistical methods. The use of statistical emulators offers a way forward."

Existing methods such as Discrete Event Simulation are limited in their ability to model the behavior of crews and of individuals who make decisions subject to their perceptions of uncertain conditions. Agent-Based Simulation may offer a better solution because agents can be applied with behavioral models. The aim of this work was to build an experimental tool capable of reflecting the emergent nature of production in construction. This required capturing trade crew behaviors through interviews and encapsulating the behavior in software agents. The system models trades' decision-making and situational awareness while using a Building Information Model to define the physical and the process environment for the simulation. The resulting simulation tool was validated by testing predictable scenarios, which resulted in similar patterns to those found in an actual construction site. It was then applied to explore the emergent outcomes of more complex scenarios. Emergent outcomes result from interaction of behavior, environment (context), and events. [Display omitted] •EPIC (Emergent Production in Construction) is an experimental agent-based simulation.•EPIC is uniquely capable of modeling the decisions and interactions of trade crews.•Existing agent-based simulations use simplistic geometry; EPIC uses BIM models.•EPIC was validated with seven predictable scenarios and tested on four new scenarios.•EPIC proved applicable for testing different modes of construction control policies."

The results clearly indicate that the efficiency benefits of one-shot auctions are quickly eroded under dynamic settings. Furthermore, the auction mechanism is not found to be superior to fixed payment schemes except when the latter involve the use of high prices."
HolderieathJason2016Smuh,,Spatiotemporal management under heterogeneous damage and uncertain parameters. An agent-based approach,"Holderieath, Jason",2016,,,,,,,,,"Species are often viewed as either beneficial or detrimental. The determination of beneficial or detrimental depends on the evaluator, often with disagreement within disciplines such as agriculture or wildlife biology. One common argument against a species revolves around its status as native or non-native, with the latter as a negative characteristic. Defining native and non-native is highly subjective, with a common North American delineation as an introduction before and after Columbus, respectively (Nelson 2010). However, in the past, native species such as the American buffalo (Bison bison) have been targets of eradication campaigns and even today white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and Canadian geese (Branta Canadensis) populations are managed to limit the damage they inflict on agriculture. It is also acknowledged that these example species have intrinsic value in the ecosystem and value as a recreationally hunted species in the case of white-tailed deer and Canadian geese. Non-native species can be viewed beneficially, as most agricultural species are introduced, for recreational use, and even as a replacement for extirpated native species (Schlaepfer, Sax and Olden 2011; Zivin, Hueth and Zilberman 2000). In the US, one contentious species is feral swine (Sus scrofa). Federal removal and control efforts are underway as some private landowners encourage their growth on their property (Bevins et al. 2014; Bannerman and Cole 2014). Feral swine are a vector for diseases, cause ecosystem damage, and inflict physical losses to agriculture (Pimentel, Zuniga and Morrison 2005; Cozzens 2010; Seward et al. 2004). However, feral swine are a valuable recreational species. With benefits and costs often accruing to different people, conflict over management is inevitable. As in most externality problems, property lines do not inhibit damage. Unique to most externality problems is the way the damage causing agent can multiply and spread unaided once introduced. Stakeholders include agricultural landowners, recreational landowners, private conservationists, and government entities. Agriculturalists may be sensitive to crop damage and unwilling to sell hunting licenses on their property to offset the damage. Recreational users may enjoy the opportunity to hunt feral swine or may be sensitive to habitat damage and predation of other game species. Private individuals may also own land with the expressed purpose of native habitat conservation. This division between agriculturalist, recreationists, and conservationists is in reality too strong. Landowners are often a mix of the three. Landowners may also exhibit inconsistent preferences or a lack of information, implying a need to relax rationality assumptions. Rational choice theory, or the rationality assumptions, require that a consumer's actions exhibit completeness, transitivity, and perfect information. Finally, government entities are responsible for many goals including preservation of native species, maintenance of protective structures such as levees, and preventing outbreaks of dangerous diseases. These varying objectives can result in inconsistent policymaker actions (Karp et al. 2015). Management decisions by one stakeholder will affect the outcomes of all stakeholders. The variety of opinions and the interaction between landowners, government agencies, and the swine themselves make an optimal policy solution, here defined as the policy solution with the highest total welfare gain, hard to determine. Previous work has ignored interaction between people and swine, spatial issues, temporal characteristics of feral swine spread, or the variety of values held among stakeholders. To address these shortcomings, an agent-based modeling approach is used to determine the optimal management solution, as well as how varying stakeholder opinions and rationality can change the optimal solution. Agent-based modeling promises to be able to model a rich diversity in objectives across time and space (Heckbert, Baynes and Reeson 2010). Applications of agent-based modeling demonstrate its capabilities with interactive heterogeneous agents and spatiotemporally explicit modeling (Evans and Kelley 2004; Schreinemachers et al. 2009; Berger and Troost 2014). Agents can be modeled maintaining traditional compatibility with economic theory (e.g. utility maximizing rational agents), with varying degrees of rationality and awareness of their surroundings, and established tools such as linear programming can be used to help agents make decisions (Berger 2001; Schreinemachers et al. 2009). ABMs have been shown to be suited for analysis of policy intended to address previously unseen events such as the effects of climate change or a new trade agreement (Berger 2001; Berger and Troost 2014). This paper will demonstrate the importance of the interaction between individuals across time and space over management decisions in a way that has not previously been published. Management paths have been established for heterogeneous groups of agriculturalists, recreational land users, private conservationists and governmental entities with varying motivations. The setting for the simulations is a hypothetical rural environment with the potential for feral swine and damage to crops, livestock, and habitat. Results from these simulations are being compared to situations with individuals of heterogeneous preferences. Preliminary results indicate that both locality and individual characteristics matter in determining the optimal outcome. The code for the ABM is being written in a program that provides striking visuals in addition to the quantitative data needed for analysis. These visualizations, the research goals, and the subject matter of feral swine have not failed to generate substantial discussion when presented. The model, properly calibrated, can be used to simulate a potential management area to determine the best path forward. Results of the analysis are expected to inform policymakers to help guide hunting license protocol and public management efforts to manage feral swine in a humane, environmentally sustainable, and socially responsible manner."

Team science provides a particularly challenging context because of the interplay across levels of analysis. For example, team performance is decisively influenced by accumulated individual attributes, the interactions among individuals and emergent team structures—each of which is affected by multiple feedback loops at different levels of analysis. To address these challenges, we compare the modeling methods of stock‐and‐flow models, agent‐based models and social network analysis to argue for the advantages of a hybrid approach to formal mathematical modeling in a team science context. We develop a proof‐of‐concept model, which combines aspects of all three methods, to investigate the effects of expertise, the patterns of members’ interactions and diversity‐based subgroups on team performance. Novel, important insights into team science theory result from this investigation, including, among others, the dynamic tradeoff between diversity and homogeneity on teams’ performance and the importance of the communication network structure in affecting that tradeoff. © 2019 System Dynamics Society"
HuangQingxu2013Elca,,"Exurban land cover and land market evolution: Analysis, review and computational experimentation of spatial and agent heterogeneity from the bottom up","Huang, Qingxu",2013,,,,,,,University of Waterloo,,"This dissertation investigates selected empirical and theoretical aspects of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) in exurban areas. Two challenges – observation and monitoring of LUCC, and spatially explicit modeling, are addressed using three main approaches – measuring, reviewing and agent-based modeling (ABM). All of these approaches focus on LUCC at the individual household level, investigating how micro-scale elements interact to influence macro-scale functional patterns—bottom-up analysis. First, the temporal change of the quantity and pattern of land-cover types within exurban residential parcels in three townships in the southeastern Michigan is examined using landscape metrics and local indicators of spatial association at the parcel and parcel-neighborhood level respectively. The results demonstrate that the number and area of exurban residential parcels increased steadily from 1960 to 2000, and different land-cover types have distinctive temporal changes over time. The results also indicate that there is a convergence process at the neighborhood level through which the quantity and pattern of land cover in parcels conform with the neighborhood appearance. Second, 51 urban residential choice models based on ABM are reviewed. The results divide these models into three categories (i.e. models based on classical theories, models focusing on different stages of urbanization process; and integrated ABM and microsimulation models). This review also compares the differences among these models in their representations of three essential features brought by the technique of ABM: agent heterogeneity, the land market and output measurement. Challenges in incorporating these features, such as the trade-off between the simplicity and abstraction of model and the complexity of urban residential system, interactions of multiple features and demands for data at individual level, are also discussed. Third, the effects of agent heterogeneity on spatial and socioeconomic outcomes under different levels of land-market representations are explored through three experiments using a stylized agent-based land-market model. The results reveal that budget heterogeneity has prominent effects on socioeconomic outcomes, while preference heterogeneity is highly pertinent to spatial outcomes. The relationship between agent heterogeneity and macro-measures becomes more complex as more land-market mechanisms are represented. The results also imply that land-market representation (e.g., competitive bidding) is indispensable to reproduce the results of classical urban land market models (e.g., monocentric city model) in a spatial ABM when agents are heterogeneous."

First, an agent-based model of two generic combined arms teams is used to study the relationships between six key attributes of combined arms teams: communication, detection, lethality, mobility, protection and sustainment. Second, a genetic algorithm is applied to evolve strategies for combined arms teams against a static opposing force. Finally, a two-population genetic algorithm is used to coevolve two forces against each other. Games theory is used to analyse the results and to provide advice on the impact of adding, removing and replacing assets or capabilities within the teams. We conclude that diversity and specialization within combined arms teams is essential. Furthermore, no single combined arms team is sufficient to ensure a tactical victory on the battlefield against all potential opponents. A range of different options for constructing combined arms teams is required."

Simatupang, Togar",2013,Business process management journal,19,5,841-860,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose – This paper aims to explore major causes of the failure of the existing subsidized liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution system and recommends alternative strategies. Design/methodology/approach – The analysis of subsidized LPG with a closed distribution system was carried out based on preliminary study, secondary data collection, and in-depth interviews to identify the root causes of the failure in achieving the desired service levels. In this research, agent based modeling and simulation was used to explain the phenomena occurred in the closed distribution system represented by three types of agents, namely selling agents, sub-selling agents, and end-users. Findings – Agent based modeling and simulation was successfully applied to describe the undesired symptoms in the closed distribution system. The simulation shows that the distribution system provides a service level of 81.61 percent by selling agents and 97.38 percent by sub-selling agents. The root cause analysis indicates that service and inventory levels in the LPG distribution system are strongly influenced by end-users demand variations, rationing system, and the occurrence of inventory leakage. To enhance the system quality, the Indonesian Government needs to implement the LPG with a closed distribution system using control card in real practice so that monitoring system can be significantly improved and ensure well-targeted subsidy. Research limitations/implications – This research is limited to the discussion of inventory level and availability. It does not include the issue of pricing, speculation, and targeting accuracy, because of the limitation of the existing data. Practical implications – This research will assist stakeholders involved in the distribution system such as selling agents and retailers to better understand the true potential of the LPG closed distribution system in preventing shortages. Originality/value – This paper describes that agent based modeling and simulation is very useful, especially to gain insights for improving the LPG closed distribution system."
MertensAnouk2017Ocfl,,Organisational challenges for local maize value chains in the biobased economy,"Mertens, Anouk",2017,,,,,,,Ghent University. Faculty of Bioscience Engineering,,"Societal challenges drive an increased interest to transform our fossil resources based to a biobased economy, in which biomass is used for the production of bioenergy and biomaterials. Research aiming to enhance this biobased economy often focuses on the technical and techno-economic aspects of converting biomass into value-added biobased products, but fails to take into account non-technical aspects, such as the organizational challenges related to local biomass value chains. These organizational challenges originate from the unique characteristics of the biomass itself, and those of the economic agents involved in the value chain. In this dissertation, we therefore focused on the organizational aspects of local biomass value chains for new applications within the biobased economy. We used local maize value chains in Flanders as case-study. Our research integrated findings from qualitative research with simulation results from a quantitative dynamic modelling approach, being agent-based modelling. We demonstrated the importance of the local context in the trade of silage maize, and identified several organizational challenges that need to be addressed for the development of a corn stover value chain in Flanders. This allows us to formulate five practical recommendations for practitioners: (1) try to work with intermediaries when you are a new entrant into an already existing local biomass value chain; (2) retain an adequate level of flexibility; (3) make a well-considered choice about the organizational form of new value chains; (4) make sure all stakeholders are involved when developing new local biomass value chains for new applications in the biobased economy; and (5) pay special attention to create trust and enthusiasm for the new value chain amongst all stakeholders involved. In general, we advocate a value chain perspective when developing new local biomass value chains for the biobased economy."

This paper presents the findings of microsimulating vehicle transaction decisions as a process of first-time vehicle purchase, acquisition, trade, disposal, and transaction or do nothing decisions. Vehicle transaction decision processes are simulated within an agent-based integrated Transport Land Use and Energy (iTLE) modeling system. The influence of life-stage transitions and interactions of decisions at different domains along the life-time is accommodated as lead and lag events within the micro-behavioral models and computational procedures of iTLE. For example, trade and disposal decisions are found to be positively influenced by residential move as 1-year lead and 2-year lead events respectively. The simulation starts by generating baseline information for 2006 and runs for 15 years from 2007 to 2021 for Halifax, Canada. The validation results suggest that the majority of the predicted vehicle ownership levels lie within a few percentage points from the observed population. For instance, zero vehicle ownership is under-represented by 1% only. In terms of microsimulation results, a higher proportion of zero vehicle ownership households is predicted in the Halifax urban core. Households with a higher vehicle ownership level are predicted to reside towards the suburban areas. For vehicle transaction type, a higher proportion of first vehicle purchase is predicted to include lower income younger population. In 2021, the average vehicle per household member is predicted to be 0.72. Around 75% of the households are predicted to own at least one vehicle per household member. At the neighborhood-level, the median value of average vehicle ownership per household is predicted to increase to 1.41 in 2021 from 1.37 in 2007. In summary, this paper offers interesting insights on the spatio-temporal evolution of vehicle ownership and transaction pattern, which will assist in testing alternative transport and land use policies."

Gender specificity with respect to land-use options and responsiveness to agents that offer related investment opportunities is poorly understood. We combined agent-based modeling and experimental role playing games to compare land-use preferences and decisions between men and women in a landscape dominated by rubber agroforests in Sumatra, Indonesia. Ecosystem service delivery can be influenced by gender specific land-use preferences, especially in areas under conservation agreements. The research methods were designed to examine gender aspects of three ‘bounds’ of human nature (bounded rationality, bounded willpower and bounded self-interests) in relation to land-use decisions. Rice fields (mostly owned and inherited by females) provide part of local staple food needs in the study area, whereas rubber agroforests provide income in addition to resources for local use and rubber and oil palm monocultures are fully market oriented. In both the model and game exercises, men preferred the status quo rice production in combination with agroforest land uses, but women preferred the conversion of agroforest to more financially profitable monoculture systems, with increased carbon emissions as side effect. Although both genders exhibited similar preferences for ecosystem service provision, regulatory ecosystem services (i.e., climate and water regulation) were reduced by women’s landuse choices. Thus, ecosystem service tradeoffs are potentially greater in women-dominated landscapes under these circumstances. Furthermore, gender-specific limitations and socio-cultural contexts (i.e., matrilineal societies) may influence the flow of ecosystem services as well as landscape patterns."

Market properties such as the price, return, trading volume, and heterogeneity among traders are provided to analyze the role of intelligence. We find that the influence of intelligence on the market crucially depends on the representation of intelligence or the learning method. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Sustainability encompasses environmental, social, and economic aspects, often referred to as the three pillars of sustainability. To make more sustainable design decisions, engineers need tools to predict the environmental, social, and economic impacts of products and characterize potential sustainability tradeoffs. To predict the total impact of a product, the quantity of functional units of the product in society and the impact of each product needs to be estimated. This article uses agent-based modeling (ABM), combined with tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA), to predict impacts across all three pillars of sustainability. By using the product impact results, the multidimensional sustainability tradespace can be characterized. The approach described in this article is based on three main components for the predictive modeling of product impacts and the characterization of the sustainability trade space: (i) ABM of product adoption, (ii) the assessment of product impacts, and (iii) an approach for the characterization of product sustainability tradeoffs at the population level. The tradespace characterization uses a Pareto-based method presented visually to find the nondominated solutions in the product impact space. To illustrate and describe how to use the method, a case study is presented that predicts the impact of residential solar panels in a region of the United States under various scenarios. The findings of the case study can help policy makers understand suitable implementation strategies for residential solar panels while considering the impact tradeoffs involved."
SeviEnrico2010Eooc,,Effects of organizational citizenship behaviour on group performance Results from an agent-based simulation model,"Sevi, Enrico",2010,Journal of modelling in management,5,1,25-37,,,Emerald Group Publishing,BINGLEY,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) on organizational effectiveness. Specifically, it investigates the impact of helping behaviour on a group where members withhold the effort on job. Design/methodology/approach - Results are drawn from an agent-based simulation model of a workgroup that has to accomplish some tasks for a specific duration. Findings - When there are group members withholding effort, OCB decreases organizational effectiveness; on the contrary, when individuals provide much effort in the job, OCB enhances group performance. High performance is reached by the group who are able to learn when OCB is appropriate and fitting. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of this paper are strictly linked to the absence of empirical analysis. The simulation model provides a logical and consistent theory that needs an empirical validation. Practical implications - This paper helps workers and supervisors since it warns them on the OCB gap and suggests that in the place of a blind OCB, the groups need to share a smart OCB to cultivate altruism with people who work hard, and to exclude the others. Originality/value - In the study of OCBs determinants and consequences, the academy has almost exclusively assembled on positive factors. This paper shows the OCB dark side and it asserts that citizenship effects on organization performance are not predetermined as a conceptual assumption. Effectiveness is assured by a dynamic and selective OCB only toward good workers."
SeagrenChadW2014EAaD,,Evolutionary Agents and Dynamic Analysis of Accident Law,"Seagren, Chad W",2014,,,,,,,,,"We employ an agent-based computational model to gain insights regarding relationships in accident law that are often overlooked in neoclassical theorizing. We consider the situation faced by the inhabitants of Eggtopia, a fictitious society whose members search for and collect precious eggs. In the course of their productive efforts they occasionally experience destructive accidents with other individuals. The inhabitants face trade-offs in that engaging in behavior that increases their productivity may also increase the possibility of an accident. We demonstrate how the agent-based model developed in this paper can be used to answer the questions commonly addressed in the mainstream literature, while also opening up new avenues of investigation. While certain outcomes are consistent with neoclassical theory, we find that agents may elect to be careful even when the neoclassical theory predicts otherwise, and particular negligence rules tend to differ significantly in their ability to rid society of negligent behavior."

This study explores the impact of a financing scheme on company performance during business growth, since new banking constraints for credit risk reduction have been introduced (such as BASEL III regulations). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a longitudinal empirical case study of a Swiss family-owned SME during a phase of intense growth, we have built a simulation model by combining agent-based with system dynamics modelling that comprehensively represents the growing firm, its decision-making, and enables the impact evaluation of relevant financial KPIs on financial sustainability. Our analysis shows that the baseline scenario entails 80% risk of bankruptcy for high-growth SMEs; featuring 30 days customer accounts receivable flow time target and a credit limit allowed by the financial partner of 25% of last period turnover. However, if customer accounts receivable flow time is reduced to ten days, and credit limit increased to 65% of last turnover, the risk of bankruptcy drops to 30%. Our findings point to the detrimental unanticipated side effects of macro-level banking regulation on micro-level firm performance, and hence have implications for policy-making. Moreover, our study guides managers and financial service providers in anticipating risky situations, and in taking corrective actions by effectively managing financial KPIs."

This paper constructs an agent-based model of bidders to compare the performance of alternative procurement auction formats under circumstances where bidders submit continuous bid supply functions and learn over time to adjust their bids in order to improve their net incomes. The results provide some confirmation of analytical predictions but also indicate that the range of bidding strategies employed is richer than what the theory expects. Bidder coordination for higher prices is possible under both the Vickrey and uniform auctions, especially when the population is heterogeneous and competition low. Judged by budgetary measures, the discriminatory auction is the most expensive when rationing is tight, but this outcome is reversed when rationing is less stringent. Budgetary outcomes can be improved if the auction is organized among more homogeneous bidders.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

We take a critical stock take of such applications to date, and reflect on their contribution to value chain sustainability and resilience. The stock take shows that the rate of industry or policy adoption has been limited, partly due to the complex interactions across the segments of agricultural value chains, and the mathematical representation being different to the way the decision maker understands the problem. OR practice in agriculture is also being asked to cover greater spatial scales and engage more stakeholders, and is required to embrace resilience and sustainability objectives. A single-minded focus on optimizing parts of these complex systems without considering the whole system is no longer adequate, and new methods and approaches are required. Complex systems science methods are being applied to analyse the dynamics of complex social-ecological systems, and are starting to find a home in industrial supply chain analysis. We demonstrate how three complex system methods, agent-based modelling, dynamical systems modelling and network analysis, can be applied to agricultural value chains as a means of gaining insights into system dynamics under different and dynamic conditions. The relevance and utility of OR in ensuring the success of agricultural value chains into the future will require practitioners to understand and model value chains as complex adaptive systems."

KwasnikTed2019QRIf,,Quantifying Resolution Implications for Agent-based Distributed Energy Resource Customer Adoption Models,"Kwasnik, Ted and Sigrin, Benjamin O and Bielen, David A",2019,,,,,,,,United States,"In this report we explore tradeoffs of top-down and bottom-up methods in their precision and computational burden using NREL's dGen model, an agent-based model of residential and non-residential distributed PV adoption. In particular, we assess the role of agent resolution in instantiating statistically-representative populations in the model--and the resulting variance of model projections at the state, sector and county levels. Running the model for a single state with fixed macroeconomic assumptions, we vary both the number of agents instantiated and the number of unique simulations. Notably, in each run we introduce sources of uncertainty in cumulative DPV adoption results during agent instantiation as we stochastically sample agent attributes from localized building characteristic and solar resource distributions. We find three key trends which guide what can be expected of results. First, precision of the model projections, as measured by the variance of the unique simulations increased as a function of the number of agents sampled, though with diminishing returns to scale. The result is expected given the Law of Large Numbers. Second, the mean or expected value of projections decreased as the number of agents instantiated increased. Empirically, aggregate DPV capacities projected by dGen are 7% lower on average at a 10-agent resolution compared to 1-agent resolutions, and up to 10% lower in the non-residential sector. We attribute this outcome to a system sizing scheme that biases lower cumulative installed capacity as agent resolution increases when roof size and load are not positively correlated. Finally, the variance of model projections differed by sector, where variance was substantially larger in the commercial sector, largely due to differences in parameterization by sector. We explain the larger variance in the non-residential sector as an outcome of the greater variance in building uses and load shapes as compared to the residential sector, and we find that a resolution on the order of 100-agents per county would be necessary to bring non-residential variance in line with residential variance at a 2-agent resolution. We propose that further research explore increasing precision and agent resolution in the non-residential sector. Moreover, given that days of intensive computing may be required to resolve a suitable estimate even at the extent of a single state within acceptable levels of precision, to promote computational efficiency we also suggest more clearly quantifying sources of variability at the county level such that resolution can by dynamically increased where county level results are least precise."

HakeSim, an agent-based model of this fishing industry, is used to explore these interactions, how companies could cope with increased fuel prices, and to provide insight into profit-risk trade-offs and vulnerabilities of companies. Apart from increasing catch per unit effort (CPUE), which is often detrimental to fish stocks, fuel price increases could be offset by increasing hake market value, achieved by processing fish to higher value end products with a lower catch cost per tonne. Industry's present fleet size and composition is demonstrated to result from profit-risk trade-offs: the flexibility to respond to mismatches between total allowable catch and CPUE, market demands for frozen and fresh product types, and environmental variability. Smaller companies have less risk-averse strategies and are more vulnerable to uncertainty in catches than larger companies, which may explain ongoing trends in consolidation in the industry. Increasing the proxy for environmental uncertainty increased risk to all companies without increasing profits. Incorporating more realistic environmental effects and feedbacks with industry in HakeSim could be an exciting future direction. •Novel agent-based model assesses importance of drivers & profit-risk tradeoff strategies.•Increasing value of hake products can offset increased fuel costs.•Industry fleet size may reduce losses & help catch quota under CPUE-TAC mismatches.•Small companies are less risk-averse and more vulnerable to uncertainty in catches.•Increased environmental uncertainty proxy increased financial risk to all companies."

A multi-paradigm simulation combined agent-based and discrete-event modelling to represent flows and estimate kilometers travelled, CO2 emissions, and costs resulting from combinations of ECR strategies and scenarios. Full ownership container substitution combined with extended free temporary storage at the dry port (FTDP) most improved ECR metrics, despite implementation challenges.

SomanSethuram2008AAMo,,An Agent-Based Model of Multifunctional Agricultural Landscape Using Genetic Algorithms,"Soman, Sethuram and Misgna, Girmay and Kraft, Steven E and Lant, Chris and Beaulieu, Jeffrey R",2008,,,,,,,,,"Landowner characteristics influence his/her willingness to change landuse practices to provide more or less environmental benefits. However, most studies of agricultural/environmental polices identify landowners as homogenous. And, the primary cause of failure of many environmental and other polices is the lack of knowledge on how humans may respond to polices based on changes in their behavior (Stern, 1993). From socioeconomic theory and empirical research, landowners can be identified as individuals who make agricultural landuse decisions independently based on their objectives. Identifying possible classes of landowners, assessing how each would potentially respond to policy alternatives, and the resulting pattern of land uses in a watershed or a riparian corridor would be very useful to policy makers as they evaluated alternatives. Agricultural landscapes are important producers of ecosystem services. The mix of ecosystem services and commodity outputs of an agricultural landscape depends on the spatial pattern of land uses emerging from individual land use decisions. However, many empirical studies show that the production of ecosystem services from agricultural landscapes is declining. This is consistent with research conducted over the last few decades showing there is a narrow range of social circumstances under which landowners are willing to make investments in the present to achieve public benefits in the future through investing in natural capital resulting in public goods which are frequently produced as ecosystem services. In this study an agent-based model within a watershed planning context is used to analyze the tradeoffs involved in producing a number of ecosystem services and agricultural commodities given price and policy scenarios while assuming three different types of agents in terms of their goals. The agents represent landowners who have been divided into a number of different groups based on their goals and the size of their farm operations. The multi-agent-based model is developed using a heuristic search and optimization technique called genetic algorithm (GA) (Holland), which belongs to a broader class of evolutionary algorithms. GAs exhibit three properties (1) they start with a population of solution, (2) they explore the solution space through recombination and mutation and (3) they evaluate individual solutions based on their appropriate fitness value(s), for example given profit maximizing agents this would be gross margin. A GA is a heuristic stochastic search and optimization method, which works by mimicking the evolutionary principles and chromosomal processing in natural genetics. The three economic agents that are modeled are based on variations in their objective functions and constraints. This study will help in identifying the tradeoffs associated with various agents in the provision of ecosystem services and agricultural commodities. The agent model developed here will help policy and decision maker identify the various agents within the watershed and assess various policy options based on that information. The study will also help to understand the interaction and feedback between the agents and their environment associated with various policy initiatives. The results of the study indicate that the agent model correctly predicts the actual landuse landcover map by 75 percent."

SmajglAlex2018PPaI,,Participatory Processes and Integrated Modelling Supporting Nexus Implementations,"Smajgl, Alex",2018,,,,71-92,,,Springer International Publishing AG,Switzerland,"Policymakers and donors are increasingly requesting researchers to investigate the water, food, and energy nexus. This is largely due to the investment risks in the form of unintended side effects causing trade-offs between these three highly connected sectors. Applying nexus approaches requires researchers to step from a pure conceptualisation of the water, food, and energy nexus to nexus implementations that effectively inform policy and planning processes. Nexus implementations, however, come with two major challenges. One challenge is the development of diagnostic and analytical tools that may be applied to (at least) three sectors in an integrative way, which would allow us to investigate cross-sector dynamics. The second challenge is concerned with stakeholder engagement during the implementation, as nexus-related decision making processes involve competing sector interests. Facilitating evidence-based policy negotiation demands research processes to effectively bridge science and a highly contested policy space. This paper explores solutions for these two challenges and presents new and refined approaches to support the implementation of the water, food, and energy nexus in real world planning and policymaking contexts. Nexus implementations can utilise agent-based modelling to simulate possible nexus trade-offs. Bayesian approaches, on the other hand, can quantify probabilities of expected outcomes. Despite the increase in analytical complexity, stakeholder learning and policy uptake can be achieved through participatory processes, using various types of process designs. Robust monitoring and evaluation of research process designs is paramount for improving our ability to effectively implement complex nexus approaches in applied policy contexts."

We construct an agent-based simulation in which multidepartment firms with different designs face environments whose turbulence and complexity we control. The models results produce two sets of testable hypotheses. One set pinpoints formal designs that cope well with three different environments: turbulent settings, in which firms must improve their performance speedily; complex environments, in which firms must search broadly; and settings with both turbulence and complexity, in which firms must balance speed and search. The results shed new light on longstanding notions such as equifinality. The other set of hypotheses argues that the impact of individual design elements on speed and search often depends delicately on specific powers granted to department heads, creating effects that run contrary to conventional wisdom and intuition. Ample processing power at the bottom of a firm, for instance, can slow down the improvement and narrow the search of the firm as a whole. Differences arise between our results and conventional wisdom when conventional thinking fails to account for the powers of department headspowers to withhold information about departmental options, to control decision-making agendas, to veto firmwide alternatives, and to take unilateral action. Our results suggest how future empirical studies of organizational design might be fruitfully coupled with rigorous agent-based modeling efforts."

However, the recent volatility exhibited by many restructured power markets, in combination with several prominent market failures, have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the complex interactions between the various market participants and the emerging overall market behavior. Advanced modeling approaches are needed that simulate the behavior of electricity markets over time and model how market participants may act and react to changes in the underlying economic, financial, and regulatory environments. This is particularly useful for developing sound market rules that will allow these markets to function properly. A new and promising approach is to model electricity markets as complex adaptive systems using an agent-based modeling and simulation approach, such as is implemented in the electricity market complex adaptive system (EMCAS) software. EMCAS provides an agent-based framework to capture and investigate the complex interactions between the physical infrastructures and the economic behavior of market participants that are a trademark of the newly emerging markets.

The introductory chapter first covers the main monetary and economic concepts on money. The second chapter deals with the emergence of money as a medium of exchange.Â Social intelligence begins to discover and propagate certain agents who improve their own fitness by supplanting direct exchange by indirect exchange.Â In other words, a two stage exchange process replaces a barter trade when some agents increase propensities to accept one commodity in exchange for all other goods irrespective of a temporary impairment of fitness.Â This account differs from Kiyotaki-Wright type models which assume different transaction/storability costs for different goods and specify agent types. The third and fourth chapters extend this model to investigate the effect of different trade network structures in monetary equilibria.Â When static network structures are given, highly connected networks bring about a universal currency.Â As connectivity decreases, more than one medium of exchange can exist simultaneously within localized areas of the network.Â With dynamic trade networks where agents can choose trading partners, multiple middle-men nodes of hubs emerge naturally regardless of the initial topology. The fifth chapter makes use of the agent-based approach, social network analysis and theory of coalitional games to model the evolution of the topology of the client-correspondent banking network in the clearance and settlement of large value payments.Â The simulator has also been calibrated with real payments data from the 2001 Bank of England Survey of CHAPS payments.Â The liquidity pricing regime chosen by a Central Bank is found to affect the tiering process."
VillamorGraceB.2023GaWN,,Gender and Water-Energy-Food Nexus in the Rural Highlands of Ethiopia: Where Are the Trade-Offs?,"Villamor, Grace B.",2023,Land (Basel),12,3,585-,,,Mdpi,BASEL,"The introduction of modern bioenergy alternatives is promoted to address water-energy-food (WEF) security in the rural highlands of Ethiopia. While the role of women in WEF security is an essential component of these challenges, gender dimensions remain invisible in the nexus debate. This study explores the impact of gender-specific roles between female- and male-headed households on the nexus resources in the rural highlands of Ethiopia using an agent-based modeling approach. This includes capturing the gender-specific responses to modern bioenergy interventions to address current energy crises that may reduce or enhance synergies among nexus resources and whether the introduction of modern bioenergy technology would improve the quality of life for both men and women. Using the participatory gendered mental model of the food-energy-land nexus, a base ABM was developed to simulate the predicted effects under scenarios of population growth and labor reallocation. Initial simulation results show that there is low adoption of alternative bioenergy (i.e., biogas digesters), and the majority remain dependent on traditional energy sources (e.g., fuel wood and animal dung), suggesting further land degradation. Female-headed households that adopt biogas increase their burden of collecting water needed for the operation. Reallocation of labor from crop production to fuelwood collection would result in the reduction of crop yields. It is expected that male-headed households have better crop yields than female counterparts due to gender-specific roles. However, by shifting 10% of labor allocated from energy collection to crop production, yields (i.e., teff and wheat) produced by female-headed households would be comparable to their male counterparts, enhancing their food security. However, the reduced workloads for women resulting from the adoption of biogas digesters will not necessarily enhance their quality of life. This study suggests that trade-offs may arise between efficiency (in resource use) and social equity, which deserve to be further analyzed."

Our research is based on a detailed cartographic review of maps made during the War of Succession, largely improving preexisting studies based on books of itineraries from the sixteenth century onwards. We build a new, complete map of the main roads at the beginning of the eighteenth century along with the matrix of transport costs for all the important towns describing the communications network. Our study of this complex network, supplemented by a counterfactual analysis carried out using a simulation model based on agents using different centralized decision-making processes, allows us to establish three main results. First, existing trade flows at the beginning of the eighteenth century had a radial structure, so the Bourbon infrastructure plan only consolidated a preexisting situation. Second, the development of the network did not suppose important alterations in the comparative centrality of the regions. Finally, the design of the paved road network was adequate for the economic needs of the country. These findings are in stark contrast with claims that the radial structure of the Bourbon roads was designed ex-novo with political or ideological objectives rather than economic ones. Our methodology paves the way to further studies of path-dependent, long-term processes of network design as the key to understanding the true origin of many currently existing situations."

An infectious disease spreads across the network of agents’ social and economic contacts and feeds back on the economic dimension of the model through various channels such as employment and consumption demand. Under a lockdown (LD) scenario, the model is able to closely reproduce the epidemiological dynamics of the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic in the Lombardy region of Italy. We find that, in the presence of non-pharmaceutical interventions, there is no trade-off between lives and macroeconomic losses as a stricter LD eventually leads to superior outcomes along both dimensions. We also evaluate the efficacy of various macroeconomic stabilization policies designed to counteract the downturn generated by the epidemic and LD measures. In an agent-based setting we gain additional insights on the way in which such policies impact not only on gross domestic product but also, for instance, on firms’ defaults and relative prices. Liquidity support for firms, a short-time working scheme with compensation for workers, and direct transfer to households stand out as the most effective policy tools."

Firstly, an overview of the state-of-the-art in supply chain design methodologies that can contribute to the definition, development, and implementation of circular supply chains is presented. Conventional approach of closed-loop systems typically addresses reuse, remanufacturing, or recycling only when products reach their end of life (i.e. reactive approach). In the ReCiPSS context, circular supply chains refer to closing the loop intentionally by design in a systemic manner where the forward and reverse flows are integrated and optimized for multiple product lifecycles (i.e. proactive approach). Secondly, industrial best practices in closed-loop supply chains are identified to enhance the understanding and knowledge about practical aspects of circular supply/value chains and to benchmark the current state of the supply chains of the ReCiPSS demonstrators against the best practices. Prominent examples include companies like Ricoh, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Caterpillar, Xerox, Renault and Komatsu. These companies are OEMs that have full control of their product throughout the entire lifecycle including design, manufacturing, forward supply chain, customer use phase, reverse supply chain, recovery activities and re-distribution. Thirdly, a baseline analysis is conducted through field visits and interviews with the company representatives to understand critical success factors for circular supply chain design and development. For white goods demonstrator the purpose is to understand the preconditions in terms of supply chain when transitioning from a product sales business model to a product as a service business model whereas for the automotive spare parts demonstrator, the focus is to understand the current logistics set-up, how is it designed and operated for the current business. However, the potential critical success factors for both the demonstrators converge around the aspects of geographical locations of facilities, lead times for delivery or collection of products as well as the logistical network design. Building upon the learnings of the analysis of the state-of-the-art, industrial best practices and baseline of the two demonstrators, simulation models of the demonstrators supply chains are developed and what-if analysis is performed to explore the aspect of centralized and decentralized supply chains scenarios while keeping the aspect of economic and environmental performance in focus. Based on the simulation modelling results, trade-off analysis has been created for both demonstrators to aid in decision making for implementation of circular supply chains in line with the business model and product design."
KrejciCarolineC2015IoFC,,Impacts of Farmer Coordination Decisions on Food Supply Chain Structure,"Krejci, Caroline C and Beamon, Benita M",2015,,,,,,,Iowa State University Digital Repository,,"To increase profitability, farmers often decide to form strategic partnerships with other farmers, pooling their resources and outputs for greater efficiency and scale. These coordination decisions can have far-reaching and complex implications for overall food supply chain structural emergence, which in turn impacts system outcomes and long-term sustainability. In this paper, we describe an agent-based model that explores the impacts of farmer coordination decisions on the development of food supply chain structure over time. This model focuses on one type of coordination mechanism implementation method, in which coordinated farmer groups produce a single crop type and combine their yields to achieve economies of scale. The farmer agents' decisions to coordinate with one another depend on their evaluation of the tradeoff between their autonomy and the expected economic benefits of coordination. Each coordination decision is a bilateral process in which the terms of group reward sharing are negotiated. We capture the effects of farmers' size, income, and autonomy premia, as well as volume-price relationships and group profit-sharing rules, on the rate of farmer coordination and the number and size of groups that form. Results indicate that under many conditions, coordination groups tend to consolidate over time, which suggests implications for overall supply chain structural resilience."

The paper presents a stock-flow-consistent hybrid macro-agent-based model estimated on Japanese data to study the interdependency among the dual labor market, output, and wage dynamics. By modeling the use of secondary workers as a financial buffer for non-financial firms, the paper investigates the possible impact of uncertainty and financial fragility on inflation and the weakening of the trade off between inflation and unemployment. The paper also contributes to the recent developments in the estimation of agent-based models by presenting an original technique, which relies on the identification and optimization of surrogate models. The numerical results show that the elasticity of firms’ hiring choices to volatility in demand is the main behavioral factor affecting both inflation and the Phillips curve, revealing that uncertainty can have consequences also on prices and not only on real variables as already discussed by the literature. Inflation and Phillips curve are also influenced by the bargaining power of workers and by the indexation of minimum wages, while conventional monetary policy and fiscal policy have limited effects. Unconventional monetary policy can have unintended deflationary consequences, by allowing financially distressed firms, which are more likely to resort to secondary workers, to survive."

These results were obtained using a software package that considers more than 100 countries of the world, and the subjects of each of the countries interact with each other through trade and financial relations. The complex includes a simulator of socio-economic dynamics, built by experts from China. It acts as an external contour for a number of models of the socio-economic system of the Eurasian continent developed at the RAS Central Economics and Mathematics Institute in 2016–2018. The calculated scenarios envisage an increase in import duties on all goods from China and Russia delivered to the United States and EU countries, as well as symmetrical responses. A separate consideration is the imitation of restrictive measures in relation to all Russian export goods. It also analyzes trade relations between Russia and the rest of the world and examines the benefits of an agent-based approach for modeling socio-economic systems."
MillingtonJamesD.A.2017IMAf,,Integrating Modelling Approaches for Understanding Telecoupling: Global Food Trade and Local Land Use,"Millington, James D. A. and Xiong, Hang and Peterson, Steve and Woods, Jeremy",2017,Land (Basel),6,3,56-,,,Mdpi,BASEL,"The telecoupling framework is an integrated concept that emphasises socioeconomic and environmental interactions between distant places. Viewed through the lens of the telecoupling framework, land use and food consumption are linked across local to global scales by decision-making agents and trade flows. Quantitatively modelling the dynamics of telecoupled systems like this could be achieved using numerous different modelling approaches. For example, previous approaches to modelling global food trade have often used partial equilibrium economic models, whereas recent approaches to representing local land use decision-making have widely used agent-based modelling. System dynamics models are well established for representing aggregated flows and stores of products and values between distant locations. We argue that hybrid computational models will be useful for capitalising on the strengths these different modelling approaches each have for representing the various concepts in the telecoupling framework. However, integrating multiple modelling approaches into hybrid models faces challenges, including data requirements and uncertainty assessment. To help guide the development of hybrid models for investigating sustainability through the telecoupling framework here we examine important representational and modelling considerations in the context of global food trade and local land use. We report on the development of our own model that incorporates multiple modelling approaches in a modular approach to negotiate the trade-offs between ideal representation and modelling resource constraints. In this initial modelling our focus is on land use and food trade in and between USA, China and Brazil, but also accounting for the rest of the world. We discuss the challenges of integrating multiple modelling approaches to enable analysis of agents, flows, and feedbacks in the telecoupled system. Our analysis indicates differences in representation of agency are possible and should be expected in integrated models. Questions about telecoupling dynamics should be the primary driver in selecting modelling approaches, tempered by resource availability. There is also a need to identify appropriate modelling assessment and analysis tools and learn from their application in other domains."
MazanecJosef2006Epms,,Evaluating perceptions-based marketing strategies An agent-based model and simulation experiment,"Mazanec, Josef",2006,Journal of modelling in management,1,1,52-74,,,Emerald Group Publishing,BINGLEY,"Purpose - To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of perceptions-based market segmentation strategies: to what extent do consumers' choice rules and the distinctness and variability of consumer preferences determine the success or failure of PBMS strategies? Design/methodology/approach - The computer simulation is run on an artificial consumer market. Its firm and consumer agents enjoy a certain extent of autonomy and a limited capability of learning. Strategies for incorporating the choice information into the firms' segmentation schemes, consumers' brand choice rules, initial preference patterns and their variability over time are factors in the experimental design. Findings - The market factors ""brand choice rule"" and ""distinctness"" and ""adaptivity"" of preferences significantly influence the profit performance of the segmentation and positioning strategies. The distinctness of the initial pattern of consumer preferences turns out to be least influential while the choice rule is most important. Research limitations/implications - Computer simulation cannot replace analyses of real-world data. When, however, advanced explanatory models are made to fit to empirical data the results sometimes are disappointing (and then do not get published). Computer simulation on artificial markets assists in exploring the reasons for success or failure. Practical implications - Boundedly rational consumers; product classes which are technologically homogeneous and subject to communications-driven differentiation; consumer preferences that are directly inaccessible and must be inferred from actual brand choice; consumers' perceptions and preferences evolving over time are realistic settings. Originality/value - Controlling for conditions such as the consumers' choice rules and the distribution and variability of preferences in real markets demands a prohibitive research effort. No empirical study so far has tried to systematically relate the profit performance of marketing strategies to choice rules and preference distinctness and variability."

At this end, I attempt, to generalize the trade of everything to realize the steady state. By considering any human action as causing positive or negative externalities, the intergenerational and international generalized trades become possible. Only this generalized trade conform to the complex hypotheses of the neoclassical model whose operationalisation immediately leads to the steady state, foundation of a sustainable economy, without fluctuations and without destruction of the environment and where all the productions are clean. I find, generations import from other generations productive factors intensively used in the production of goods and services highly consumed in the current generations and export productive factors intensively used in the production of goods and services weakly consumed in the same generations. Indirectly, generations import goods and services that use a high proportion of technically scarce productive factors and a low proportion of technically abundant productive factors and export goods and services that use the reverse proportions of the same productive factors. Thus, positive externalities (unnatural resources) are exchanged against negative externalities (overconsumption of natural resources). A productive factor is technically scarce in a generation if the part of this productive factor imparted to this generation is insufficient to produce as much of these goods and services that it wishes to consume. A productive factor is technically abundant if its proportion existing in this generation is superior to its production needs. Under these conditions, I show, at the equilibrium level, each productive factor and each good or service has the same price in each generation. This realizes an efficient trade of externalities decoupling thus growth and volatility. That is why I conclude the policies to uncouple growth and volatility are also those of sustainable growth and clean production, ensuring to each generation an equivalent use of natural and unnatural resources. In contrast to AK model, I find, through widened evidence that, a greater willingness to hoard or an improvement in the level of technology shows up in the long run that higher levels of capital (unnatural resources) and output per effective worker are achieved, with no change in per capita growth rate. The steady state results in diminishing returns to inputs in the technology production. At this end, I propose, countries or generations with a high price deviation should pay to the World Environmental Bank (WEB) a tax that would be proportional to its price deviation or its growth volatility path. The factorial dotations difference between two generations/countries creates pressure difference (osmotic pressure) across a separating semi permeable border. Solvent (Populations) immigration takes place from the lower endowed generation/country to that of higher wealth, until equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium economy (steady state or sustainable development) has the same concentration of wealth both inside and outside the borders. In economics, this state is achieved when international and intergenerational leveling out of all prices is realized avoiding any growth volatility.

Suitability scores were generated for individual property parcels using criteria weights derived from surveyed retail-industry experts. To increase capacity for site selection, distributions of suitability scores were generated at census dissemination areas (populations 500-700; n = 19,963) and census metropolitan and agglomeration areas (core populations >10,000; n = 43). Analogues among metropolitan and agglomeration areas were generated and spatial clustering was used to identify groups of highly-suitable parcels within urban areas. Lastly, individual parcels can be interrogated for overall suitability or individual criteria scores. Our approach combines retail methods typically used in isolation (e.g. location quotient, Huff’s model, network analysis) and demonstrates how a simple survey can be used to weight criteria. Results show that survey respondents were in general agreement and that top-line revenues were more critical to perceived location success than development and operational costs. Analysis of suitability scores found analogues and clusters of census metropolitan areas that coincide with store sales as well as clusters of highly suitable parcels predominantly located around major highways. In addition to identifying challenges and solutions to the presented research, we also describe future research directions that extend the presented static analysis to include processes like store closure and openings, competition, and land use change through the use of agent-based modelling."

We present an agent-based land market model where land from agriculture use is transferred into urban. The model combines the microeconomic demand, supply, and bidding foundations of spatial economics models with the spatial heterogeneity of spatial econometric models in a single methodological platform. Heterogeneous agents exchange heterogeneous spatial goods via simulated bilateral market interactions. We model a coastal city where both coastal amenities and flooding or erosion disamenities drive land market outcomes, facilitating separate analysis of the effects of each driver on land rents and land development patterns. We also analyze the implications of homogeneous versus heterogeneous but unbiased flood risk perceptions. Since buyers with low risk perceptions drive market outcomes, spatial development under heterogeneous risk perceptions differs qualitatively, with more expansion into risky areas. Our results highlight the shortcomings of policy models based on representative agent assumptions and the importance of including agent-level data in empirical modeling. L'hétérogénéité de l'environnement spatial et des agents économiques constitue un élément moteur crucial de la dynamique du marché foncier. Nous présentons un modèle multi-agent du marché foncier dans lequel des terres agricoles ont été transférées pour des fins urbaines. Le modèle combine les fondements microéconomiques de la demande, de l'offre et des enchères de modèles de l'économie spatiale avec l'hétérogénéité spatiale des modèles de l'économétrie spatiale dans une plateforme méthodologique unique. Les agents hétérogènes échangent des biens hétérogènes par le biais du jeu des forces du marché bilatéral simulé. Nous avons modélisé une ville côtière où les agréments côtiers et les désagréments causés par les inondations ou l'érosion influent sur le marché foncier, facilitant l'analyse individuelle des effets de chaque élément moteur sur les loyers fonciers et les modèles d'aménagement de terrain. Nous avons également analysé les répercussions des perceptions homogènes et hétérogènes mais non biaisées à l'égard du risque d'inondation. Étant donné que les acquéreurs qui ont de faibles perceptions du risque motivent les effets du marché, le développement spatial selon des perceptions hétérogènes à l'égard du risque varie qualitativement, avec plus d'expansion dans les zones à risque.

This paper presents an approach for designers and engineers to quantify the social and environmental impacts of a product at a population-level and then perform a trade-off analysis between those impacts. In the approach, designers and engineers define the attributes of the product as well as the materials and processes used in the product’s life cycle. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) tools that have been developed to model the social impacts of products are combined with Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools that have been developed to evaluate the pressures that different processes create on the environment. Designers and engineers then evaluate the trade-offs between impacts using Pareto frontiers to find non-dominated solutions that minimize environmental impacts while maximizing positive and/or minimizing negative social impacts. Product adoption models generated by ABM allow designers and engineers to approximate population-level environmental impacts and avoid Simpson’s paradox, where a reversal in choices is preferred when looking at the population-level impacts versus the product-level impacts. This analysis of impacts has the potential to help designers and engineers create more impactful products that contribute towards the UN sustainable development goals."

For realistic modeling of agents in multicultural negotiations, the agents must display culturally differentiated behavior. This paper presents an agent-based simulation model that tackles these challenges, based on Hofstede’s model of national cultures. The context is a trade network for goods with a hidden quality attribute. The negotiation model is based on the ABMP negotiation architecture and applies a utility function that includes market value, quality preference and risk attitude. The five dimensions of Hofstede’s model are the basis for the modification of ABMP parameters and weight factors in the utility function. The agents can observe each other’s group membership and status. This information is used, along with the indices of Hofstede’s dimensions, to differentiate behavior in different cultural settings. The paper presents results of test runs that verify the implementation of the model. The model helps to explain behaviors of actors in international trade networks. It proves that Hofstede’s dimensions can be used to generate culturally differentiated agents. Further validations of the model with case studies from literature and experiments have yet to be conducted. Extensions can make this model a useful tool for training traders who engage in cross-cultural negotiation and for implementation in negotiation support systems."

Sayed and Tisdell, John G.",2016,Environmental & resource economics,64,4,537-558,,,Springer Netherlands,Dordrecht,"Establishing national corridors have been identified as a policy priority for environmental and biodiversity conservation in many parts of the world. We explore the performance of a combinatorial landscape auction design to establish environmental corridors using an agent based simulation model. This modelling technique is highly flexible in modelling decision making processes involving heterogeneous landholders. Such structures allow landholders the opportunity to submit joint bids and, as such, share in the benefits that synergies across the landscape provide. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we compare spatial and non-spatial project selection to observe whether it is possible to achieve corridor outcomes with a non-spatially targeted project selection mechanism? We observe that while a corridor project selection mechanism increases the procurement cost, such selection mechanisms are necessary for spatially targeted objectives. Second, we study the effect of allowing agents to form coalitions and submit joint bids. We find evidence that joint bidding substantially increased procurement costs especially when the agency’s target was to secure environmental corridors. Third, we study the combined effect of off-site synergies and joint bidding. We observe that relative benefits from off-site synergy are higher in spatial targeting programs compared to non-corridor targeting programs."

The model aims to address sources of asymmetries and possible converge patterns between two economies belonging to a currency union, that are initially differentiated only in terms of the education level they are able to ensure. Education is modeled as a macro-level public policy differently targeting three levels, that is primary, secondary and tertiary. After being educated, when workers enter the labour force, they face a segmented labour market, divided into three types of qualifications and resulting functions deployed inside firms, i.e., basic, medium and advanced occupations. The three markets are heterogeneous in terms of both requested education level and minimum offered wage. We experiment with different education and trade settings. Ultimately, we are interested in understanding the coupling effects of asymmetries in education, which reverberate in segmented labour markets and differentiated growth patterns. Notably, our focus on capital-goods trade, rather than on consumption goods, allows us to investigate a direct link between productive capabilities in complex products and country growth prospects."

P.",2013,Journal of geographical systems,15,4,427-451,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"Agent-based simulation has become an important modeling approach in activity-travel analysis. Social activities account for a large amount of travel and have an important effect on activity-travel scheduling. Participants in joint activities usually have various options regarding location, participants, and timing and take different approaches to make their decisions. In this context, joint activity participation requires negotiation among agents involved, so that conflicts among the agents can be addressed. Existing mechanisms do not fully provide a solution when utility functions of agents are nonlinear and non-monotonic. Considering activity-travel scheduling in time and space as an application, we propose a novel negotiation approach, which takes into account these properties, such as continuous and discrete issues, and nonlinear and non-monotonic utility functions, by defining a concession strategy and a search mechanism. The results of experiments show that agents having these properties can negotiate efficiently. Furthermore, the negotiation procedure affects individuals’ choices of location, timing, duration, and participants."

KoppThomas2018MSEP,,Modelling Social Evolutionary Processes and Peer Effects in Agricultural Trade Networks: the Rubber Value Chain in Indonesia,"Kopp, Thomas and Salecker, Jan",2018,arXiv.org,,,,,,"Cornell University Library, arXiv.org",Ithaca,"Understanding market participants' channel choices is important to policy makers because it yields information on which channels are effective in transmitting information. These channel choices are the result of a recursive process of social interactions and determine the observable trading networks. They are characterized by feedback mechanisms due to peer interaction and therefore need to be understood as complex adaptive systems (CAS). When modelling CAS, conventional approaches like regression analyses face severe drawbacks since endogeneity is omnipresent. As an alternative, process-based analyses allow researchers to capture these endogenous processes and multiple feedback loops. This paper applies an agent-based modelling approach (ABM) to the empirical example of the Indonesian rubber trade. The feedback mechanisms are modelled via an innovative approach of a social matrix, which allows decisions made in a specific period to feed back into the decision processes in subsequent periods, and allows agents to systematically assign different weights to the decision parameters based on their individual characteristics. In the validation against the observed network, uncertainty in the found estimates, as well as under determination of the model, are dealt with via an approach of evolutionary calibration: a genetic algorithm finds the combination of parameters that maximizes the similarity between the simulated and the observed network. Results indicate that the sellers' channel choice decisions are mostly driven by physical distance and debt obligations, as well as peer-interaction. Within the social matrix, the most influential individuals are sellers that live close by to other traders, are active in social groups and belong to the ethnic majority in their village."

Such networks consist of both economic flows and social relationships, which connect different production regions to different types of fish demand. The structure of such trade networks, and the actions that take place within them (e.g., people fishing, buying, selling), can influence the capacity of small-scale fisheries to provide sufficient fish in a changing social and ecological context. In this study, we aim to understand the importance of networks between different types of traders that access spatially-distinct fish stocks for the availability and variability of fish provision. We deployed a mixed-methods approach, combining agent-based modelling, network analysis and qualitative data from a small-scale fishery in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The empirical data allowed us to investigate the trade processes that occur within trade networks; and the generation of distinct, empirically-informed network structures. Formalized in an agent-based model, these network structures enable analysis of how different trade networks affect the dynamics of fish provision and the exploitation level of fish stocks. Model results reveal how trade strategies based on social relationships and species diversification can lead to spillover effects between fish species and fishing regions. We found that the proportion of different trader types and their spatial connectivity have the potential to increase fish provision. However, they can also increase overexploitation depending on the specific connectivity patterns and trader types. Moreover, increasing connectivity generally leads to positive outcomes for some individual traders, but this does not necessarily imply better outcomes at the system level. Overall, our model provides an empirically-grounded, stylized representation of a fisheries trading system, and reveals important trade-offs that should be considered when evaluating the potential effect of future changes in regional trade networks."

In this paper we look at how variations in IPRs regimes might affect the creation and social cost of new knowledge in economic systems. Drawing on a conceptual framework, the Information Space or I-Space to explore how the uncontrollable diffusibility of knowledge relates to its degree of structure, we deploy an agent-based modelling approach to explore the issue of IPRs. We take the ability to control the diffusibility of knowledge as a proxy measure for an ability to establish property rights in such knowledge. Second, we take the rate of obsolescence of knowledge as a proxy measure for the degree of turbulence induced by different regimes of technical change. Then we simulate the quantity and cost to society of new knowledge under different property right regimes."

Achieving food and nutrition security for all in a changing and globalized world remains a critical challenge of utmost importance. The development of solutions benefits from insights derived from modelling and simulating the complex interactions of the agri-food system, which range from global to household scales and transcend disciplinary boundaries. A wide range of models based on various methodologies (from food trade equilibrium to agent-based) seek to integrate direct and indirect drivers of change in land use, environment and socio-economic conditions at different scales. However, modelling such interaction poses fundamental challenges, especially for representing non-linear dynamics and adaptive behaviours. We identify key pieces of the fragmented landscape of food security modelling, and organize achievements and gaps into different contextual domains of food security (production, trade, and consumption) at different spatial scales. Building on in-depth reflection on three core issues of food security – volatility, technology, and transformation – we identify methodological challenges and promising strategies for advancement. We emphasize particular requirements related to the multifaceted and multiscale nature of food security. They include the explicit representation of transient dynamics to allow for path dependency and irreversible consequences, and of household heterogeneity to incorporate inequality issues. To illustrate ways forward we provide good practice examples using meta-modelling techniques, non-equilibrium approaches and behavioural-based modelling endeavours. We argue that further integration of different model types is required to better account for both multi-level agency and cross-scale feedbacks within the food system."
BasaureArturo2016Tvsc,,Transaction vs. switching costs—Comparison of three core mechanisms for mobile markets,"Basaure, Arturo and Suomi, Henna and Hämmäinen, Heikki",2016,Telecommunications policy,40,6,545-566,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"The fast growth in demand of mobile Internet urges mobile network operators (MNOs) to rapidly increase the wireless network capacity. For this purpose, governments are allocating large parts of the valuable low frequency spectrum to MNOs. This expansion also adds pressure to better optimize the intra-MNO and inter-MNO spectrum usage. Regulators are concerned about problems such as network blackouts, coverage disparities and congestion. Latest technology developments provide new mechanisms to address these problems through two alternative evolution paths, operator-driven and user-driven. The operator-driven path permits operators to trade network capacity and spectrum through, for instance, national roaming and dynamic spectrum access mechanisms, respectively. On the other hand, the user-driven path enables users (and traffic) to rapidly switch between networks through an end-user multihoming mechanism which intensifies retail competition. MNOs are reluctant to adopt these mechanisms if they involve risks. However, regulators can facilitate the deployment of these mechanisms by guiding the level of inter-MNO transaction costs and end-user switching costs. This paper analyzes the market dynamics of these three core mechanisms by employing agent-based modeling. Initial results indicate that each mechanism improves allocative efficiency on a dynamic basis and that such mechanisms become necessary if the current static market model based on vertically integrated MNOs is not able to meet the requirements of service quality, capacity and coverage. One promising use case of the proposed mechanisms is the indoor femto-cellular deployment which suffers from coverage disparity due to static single-MNO base stations. Moreover, either end-user multihoming or national roaming may provide MNOs a feasible business case for building indoor infrastructure by solving coverage disparity problems, by means of competition or cooperation, respectively. Dynamic spectrum access may work as an extension of the previous mechanisms for solving congestion; however, it requires higher technical and business coordination. •This paper compares end-user multihoming, national roaming and dynamic spectrum access.•It analyzes transaction and switching costs based on agent-based simulations.•These mechanisms become necessary under high coverage disparities and congestion.•One promising use case is the deployment of indoor small-cells."
YangYi-Chen2010Mwmw,,Modeling watershed management with an ecological objective - a multi-agent system based approach,"Yang, Yi-Chen",2010,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Watershed management is a practice that administers water and land resources within a watershed context for different users under spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability. Meeting water demands for both human and ecosystem and maintaining the harmonic balance between those two is one of the ultimate challenges for watershed managers. This study quantitatively defines both human and natural water users as agents in a watershed and then uses a multi-agent system (MAS) modeling framework to formulate the water allocation issue among the agents. A decentralized optimization algorithm is developed to evaluate the complexity of the watershed level outcomes resulting from different agents’ decisions. The construction of ecology-hydrology quantitative connection is the very first step to incorporate the ecological concern into the watershed planning. A data-mining approach: genetic programming (GP) is applied in this study to addressing this task. Using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHAs) to represent the environmental flow condition, genetic programming generated a quantitative relationship (equation) between natural flow regime metrics (hydrology) and fish community indices (ecology). After a robustness test shows that each metrics in the equation had a consistent relationship with the ecological index, the GP generated equation is proofed as a direct linkage between hydrology and ecology and can reflect the ecosystem status under given flow situation. Meanwhile, the verification test shows a consistent outcome between GP, a traditional statistic method: principal component analysis (PCA) and an ecological approach: autecology matrix (AM). This common outcome provides confidence in using existing and new approaches and observational data to build solid hydroecological relationships. This method is applied to a real world case study regarding using daily reservoir operation for ecosystem restoration purpose. A multi-objectives optimization model is constructed for a case study reservoir in Illinois, USA to evaluate the tradeoff between human economic purpose and ecological conservation purpose. In general, adding the ecological objective into case study reservoir operation will not jeopardize the original economic objective, which is the major concern of current reservoir operation. Meanwhile, the result can also improve the downstream fish habitats by providing a flow regime that close to the natural condition. Due to the spatial heterogeneity involved in the management issue, dividing the watershed into interconnected subsystems (agents) should be a more realistic approach for analyzing water resources management problems. Agent can be flexibly defined in any appropriate format to characterize the heterogeneous water usage. Agents in the watershed are different types of water users that include offstream human land and water users and instream water “users,” such as riparian aquatic ecosystems. Under the MAS framework, both individual agents’ objectives and the interconnection among these objectives would be addressed using mathematical format. A penalty-based decentralized optimization algorithm is used to solve the formulated mathematical problem. By introducing the local interest factor (βi), this algorithm allows agents to search for the solution in the infeasible solution space when system-wide constraints are violated. The use of β i values enables the analysis of a water resource management problem to include the impact of the various agent behaviors that β i values reflect. Aggressive agents with large β i values affect other agents, particularly the reactive ecosystem agents, and even the entire system. In the real world case study of the Yellow River Basin, China, the concept of βi has been translated into local water price (pi). The local water price, served as an institutional arrangement, is used to guide the convergence of the decentralized management. The results of different scenarios analysis shows that equilibrium local water prices can be achieved under physical constraints in the watershed that will result in lower water consumptions and higher economic benefits compare to the baseline scenario. The subsidies from the government can not only guarantee the environmental flow requirement, but also increase the system GDP at the same time. Data limitation is always a major concern for watershed management modeling analysis. The construction of quantitative hydroecological relationship using genetic programming requires long-term fish species data. The utility function for the human water agent also needs actual water consumption and economic benefit data. The modeling results can be further improved if more data become available. Incorporating the concept of uncertainty into the MAS framework is the reasonable next step of this i study. Agents' decisions will become dynamic and the results should be more close to the real world situation."

The developed artificial markets are multi-assets, order-driven and populated by agents having heterogeneous behaviors and information. Agents are defined by their information and their herd behavior levels. Agents trade multiple risky assets based on their wealth, their behaviors and their available information which spread among multiple behavioral networks. In a novel contribution to artificial stock markets literature, agents’ behaviors modeling is mixed with social network simulation to reproduce different degrees of information asymmetry and herd behavior based on several assortative topologies. Several simulations validated the proposed model since univariate and multivariate stylized facts were reproduced both for mature and immature stock markets. The proposed artificial stock market can be considered as a first step toward decision and simulation tools for optimal management, strategy analysis and predictions evolution of immature stock markets."

Different attributes of MLs can lead to uncertain and dynamic laborer behaviors (i.e. behavioral diversities), which may cause project deviations. Previous studies do not consider the uncertainties or dynamics of behaviors adequately or they only provide general suggestions. The purpose of this paper is to combine system dynamics (SD) and agent-based modeling (ABM) to build an integrated model. The proposed ABM-SD can gain better understanding of MLs’ behavioral diversities, reveal the associated impacts and improve project management. Design/methodology/approach Based on extensively review in construction labor management and computer simulation, architecture is built to depict the relationships between the affecting factors of MLs’ behaviors, MLs’ behavioral diversities and project performance. Second, conceptual structures of the ABM-SD model are developed. Third, methods to implement the model in practice are introduced, focusing on data collection and model structure adjustment. Finally, the model is tested in a case study. Findings Different ML groups have distinctive behaviors which constantly change through interactions between MLs, engineers and external environment. Inadequate consideration of the diversities can result in inaccurate estimation of productivity, work quality and absenteeism, causing severe project deviations such as schedule delay, cost overrun and high absenteeism. On the other hand, using the ABM-SD model, the root causes of project deviations are analyzed from the perspective of MLs’ behavioral diversities and the optimization of labor management can significantly improve project performance. Research limitations/implications This paper supplements previous studies because the ABM-SD model takes fully use of the strength of simulation of solving uncertain and dynamic problems and combines both qualitative and quantitative findings in existing studies of labor management. Besides, the ABM-SD model is also a practical management tool to better monitor laborer behaviors and forecast the impacts. The limitation is mainly about the small scale of the case study. However, the ABM-SD model already demonstrates the mechanism about how MLs’ different behaviors affect a project, which fulfill the aim of the study. Practical implications The ABM-SD model can simulate MLs’ behavioral diversities and produce reliable estimations of project performance. It also allows to optimize management plans. Furthermore, The ABM-SD model is adjustable based on specific project conditions, which make it applicable for different tasks, different laborer compositions and even different projects. Thus, the ABM-SD model can be a practical tool for engineers in MCPs. Originality/value SD and ABM are applied to study behaviors with well-known benefits in both separated and integrated manner. However, few studies use the approach to investigate MLs’ behaviors in MCPs. Hence, the proposed ABM-SD model is an original attempt to improve the laborer management level in MCPs."

The coffee sector is a prime example, where sustainability certification could improve livelihoods for poor smallholders. However, as individual production volumes are low, smallholder farmers need to cooperate in certification as a group, which makes impact assessment more complicated. Previous empirical studies, reporting premia of up to 30%, have neglected the costs associated with group certification. We explore the issue using an agent‐based simulation of coffee producer organisations in Uganda, including the certification‐related costs for farmers. Our results suggest that certification can have a small positive impact on participating households. But the added value of certification is substantially lower than the price premium, because of certification costs. Increasing both the membership of the producer groups and their deliveries of certified coffee are necessary to improve the rewards of certification."

FraccasciaLuca2020Qtdn,,Quantifying the direct network effect for online platforms supporting industrial symbiosis: an agent-based simulation study,"Fraccascia, Luca",2020,Ecological economics,170,,106587-,,,Elsevier B.V,AMSTERDAM,"This paper explores the direct network effect for online platforms supporting industrial symbiosis (IS), which is a recommended strategy to support the transition towards the circular economy. Through IS, companies can use wastes produced by other companies as inputs to production processes. Online platforms supporting companies in operating IS relationships can play a critical role in developing the IS practice. In this paper, an agent-based model is designed to simulate the emergence of IS relationships among companies located in a given geographical area. Companies can establish relationships traditionally (relying on face-to-face contacts) or by using a platform. Several scenarios, defined by different platform usage rates, are simulated. Results show that there is a minimum platform usage rate allowing companies to benefit from using the platform. If the platform usage rate is lower than this threshold, the platform does not contribute to generate further benefits for companies. When the platform usage rate is higher than the threshold, the individual benefits for users are higher the greater the number of other companies using the platform. Based on these results, implications on how to ensure a win-win approach for companies and platform owners can be provided, as well as implications for policymakers. •The network effect of online platforms for industrial symbiosis is studied.•The study adopts the agent-based simulation approach.•The emergence of industrial symbiosis is simulated for several platform usage rates.•Companies using online platforms have higher performance than other companies.•Benefits for each company from using the platform depend on the number of users."

It is, however, unclear whether a high diversity of social actors analogously increases the capacity of social-ecological systems to maintain the provision of ecosystem services while undergoing socio-economic and climate changes. Here, using an empirically informed agent-based modelling approach, we demonstrate that both the number of actors (actors richness) and the diversity of the abilities and skills that characterize their management capabilities (actors' functional diversity) are key determinants of the resilience of social-ecological systems to global change. A high complementarity of the actors' functional diversity helps to buffer vulnerable mountain systems against socio-economic and climate change. Actors' response diversity can mediate an abrupt shift in the social-ecological system, leading to new trade-offs in ecosystem services. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the diversity and the complementarity of actors' management capabilities to ensure the provision of ecosystem services in the face of uncertain global change."

Design/methodology/approach Recently, the idea of taking advantage of the benefits of Six Sigma and simulation models together has led both industry and the academy towards further investigation and implementation of these methodologies. From this perspective, the present research will illustrate the effectiveness of using LSS methodology in a real factory environment by using the combination of three simulation methods which are system dynamics (SD), discrete-event simulation (DES) and agent-based (AB) modelling. Findings The hybrid simulation method applied in this research was found to accurately mimic and model the existing real factory environment. The define, measure, analyse, control and improve (DMAIC)-based improvements showed that the applied method is able to improve machine utilization rates while balancing the workload. Moreover, queue lengths for several stations were shortened, and the average processing time was decreased by around 50%. Also, a weekly production increase of 25% was achieved while lowering the cost per unit by around 8%. Research limitations/implications While the case study used was for a LED manufacturing system, the proposed framework could be implemented for any other existing production system. The research also meticulously presents the steps carried out for the development of the multi-method simulation model to allow readers to replicate the model and tailor it for their own case studies and projects. The hybrid model enables managers to navigate the trade-off decisions they often face when choosing advanced production output ahead of continuous improvement practices. The adoption of methodologies outlined in this paper would attain improvements in terms of queue lengths, utilization, reduced costs and improved quality and efficiency of a real, small factory. The findings suggest improvements and create awareness among practitioners for the utilization of quality tools that will provide direct benefits to their companies. Although the multi-method simulation is effective, a limitation of the current study is the lack of micro details within each station. Furthermore, the results are all based on one specific case study which is not enough to suggest and generalized findings. Originality/value This research combines the use of the three main hybrid simulation paradigms (SD, DES and AB) in a unified framework DMAIC methodology. Choosing the right models in DMAIC is important, challenging and urgently necessary. Also, this paper shows empirical evidence on its effectiveness."

Settlement expansion, the intensification of agricultural land-use practices, and farmland abandonment result in a decline of natural and semi-natural habitats and the related ecosystem services (ES). In this context, spatial planning has emerged as a key instrument for the management of ES provision. To better understand trade-offs and interactions between settlement growth and ES provision in a spatially explicit manner, we present a new modeling framework coupling an agent-based, agro-economic optimization model and a cellular-automata-based settlement growth model. The framework is applied in an inner alpine valley in the Valais, Switzerland, which experienced rapid settlement growth in recent years. Results demonstrate how the model framework allows support of local planning processes. Particularly cooperation among municipalities and an explicit consideration of ES can inform spatially explicit ES trade-off decisions under increasing demand for land. We conclude that better informed spatial planning processes support ES provision."

They constitute additional sources of knowledge and act as intermediaries. Results also show that in a process of indirect transfer of knowledge, they have only little influence on the process of individual learning.

The author wants to measure the added value of this technology in terms of providing e-service and measure web-users' desire to have a concrete experience with a firm after experiencing its web site. Design/methodology/approach - The author integrated a virtual agent on a restaurant's web site and conducted an online survey. The author asked respondents to interact with the virtual agent and then fill in the questionnaire. The author used the expanded version of the technology acceptance model (TAM) for measuring the intention of potential customers to accept a new technology and for evaluating the characteristics of the virtual agent. In order to measure the e-service quality, the author adapted items of WebQual to restaurant industry. As the author had several latent variables, the author used partial least squares (PLS), a variance-based structural equation modeling method. Findings - Results show that the utilitarian and hedonic values of the virtual agent increase significantly the desire of potential clients to experiment the restaurant. Hedonic value seems to play a major role. This is a crucial factor for restaurant and hotel industries which can be considered as hedonic industries. Practical implications - This research can help firms to manage relationships with current and potential clients through their web site. The nature of the company plays an important role in the success of the virtual agent's implementation. Even if in the case the author applied the virtual agent to a hedonic industry, a lot of companies in other sectors can benefit from having a virtual agent, especially if the company in question is service-oriented (e.g. bank, airline, etc.). Originality/value - According to the author's knowledge, virtual agents have never been applied to restaurant/hotel industries before. The results of this research significantly advanced the understanding of the impact of virtual agents, especially in the hospitality industry. Moreover, the author applied the TAM to the characteristics of virtual agent, which is very new for the academic world. Finally, the framework the author presented in this research could be used as a basis of measurement of virtual agent effectiveness."

In this market, multiple types of investors exist and conduct trades based on the investment rules defined for each type. The experiments suggest that Passive Investment is valid in a realistic efficient market, yet it could have bad influences such as market instability and inadequate asset pricing deviation."

Salaries paid to workers are at the same time a fundamental source of aggregate demand and a determinant of firms’ international cost competitiveness. The paper investigates how alternative wage growth patterns impact on the economic dynamics of an artificial Monetary Union. For this sake, we perform several experiments employing the Agent Based-Stock Flow Consistent (AB-SFC) Multi-Country model first presented in Caiani et al. (2018a). Results show that a change in the wage growth pattern impacts in non-trivial ways on the demand and supply sides of the economies, giving rise to Keynesian and Schumpeterian effects. When occurring in a single country, wage expansions lead to a transitory deterioration of the country current account and to a slow-down of the economy in the short-run. However, on a longer time-span, higher wages tend to improve firms’ innovative performance by strengthening the process of Schumpeterian competition, providing long-run benefits in terms of higher labor productivity which allow the economy to recover. Conversely, a coordinated expansion of wages in all countries, which leaves their relative competitive position unaffected, tends to benefit real GDP, labor productivity growth, and countries’ public finance, while not affecting unemployment and countries’ external balance. A specular dynamics characterizes the experiments investigating the effects of wage moderation. Extensive sensitivity experiments show that these results are robust to different dimensions of the Monetary Union and that the efficacy of coordinated wage expansionary strategies is enhanced when consumers give more importance to price differentials in their consumption allocation decisions."

Recent developments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce enable market participation by software agents that are (almost) perfectly rational due to their computational capacity. However, the increasing degree of buyers’ rationality might have unfavorable effects on retail markets with regards to the competition between sellers and the resulting prices. In this paper, we study the effects of varying degrees of buyers’ rationality on the competition and the prices buyers face in retail markets with identical items. We use the multinomial logit function to model different degrees of buyers’ rationality. We further model the competition between sellers using k -level reasoning: each seller computes the price to offer (best response strategy) with regards to its belief for the competition. First, we derive an analytical best response strategy (price) of a seller given the competing prices and the degree of buyers’ rationality, and show that there exists an optimal degree of buyers’ rationality that minimizes the price. Last, we use evolutionary game theory to show that perfect rationality leads to unstable competition dynamics increasing the overall cost for buyers. In contrast, bounded rationality leads to smoother dynamics and lower cost for buyers. Our insights raise the need to revisit design objectives for software agents in retail markets in light of their wider systematic impact."

We present an overview of the data sources and techniques used to inform agent behavior and the destination landscape, as well as consider aspects of system representation and validation and how these may affect the use of TourSim. TourSim is used to generate three scenarios of tourism dynamics; a base-case scenario, one that simulates the effect of a decrease in visitation from American markets as a result of economic crisis, and the use of advertising as a response to this lower level of visitation. These scenarios are used to evaluate ABM in comparison with other computer-based methods of modeling tourism, namely geographic information systems and system dynamics models."

This is the first model having explicit contract-driven capacity expansion process, allowing investors to hold imperfect foresights, and simulating market power in global gas trade. With these features, Gas-GAME can analyse market development subject to the incentives and perspectives of each market player. The model simulates short-term game-theoretical market equilibrium with Mixed Complementarity Problem approach. For long-term investment decisions, bilateral contracting processes considering both import requests and export profitability are modelled. A base case is presented and validated, followed by a case study considering US export strategy. When the US stays conservative in export expansion, gas supply tightness occurs, leading to continuing European dependence on Russian gas, and a shift to pipeline-based import in the Chinese market. Conversely, when the US invests aggressively, Middle East and Australia both see significant revenue losses, and Western Europe constructs more regasification plants to provide alternatives to Russian supply. Gas-GAME captures the essential dynamics between market power, short-term prices and long-term contracts to provide a more nuanced view of global gas market. •A new model, Gas-GAME, enables analysis of global gas market dynamics.•Gas-GAME combines short-term trade and price formation with contract-driven investment.•Investors may hold different and imperfect foresights, leading to sub-optimal decisions.•US conservative LNG expansion leads to larger Russian market share in Europe.•US aggressive expansion leads to revenue challenges in the Middle East and Australia."

It is seen that restrictions on outsourcing can have a positive effect on formal sector activity. Offshoring, that is, relocating to another country, is also considered. When restrictions on offshoring are studied, it is seen that formal sector employment growth is less robust.

We explore how models capture the economic and ecological consequences of landscape pattern, and potential feedbacks to the responses by policy or landholders. Recent Findings Modelling approaches are becoming increasingly interlinked, coupling components of empirical-statistical modelling, spatial and bioeconomic simulation, land-use optimization and agent-based models. We analyse recent methodological advances and find that only few examples capture feedbacks between landscape pattern and decision-making. Summary We outline how future hybrid models could build on these recent advances by inter alia an improved representation of landscape patterns, refining the theory behind decision-making, incorporating uncertainty and reducing model complexity. We conclude that coupling recent developments in land-use optimization and agent-based models may help bridge gaps between modelling philosophies as well as parsimony vs. complexity. This fruitful field of research could help to improve understanding on the role of landscape pattern in social-ecological systems."
GoodingTim2018FFoT,,Foundational Forces of Trade : Exploring Trade in a Complex Environment Using Agent-Based Models,"Gooding, Tim",2018,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"In the short-run, there is not enough time for systemic feedback to organise and become a force. In this instance, it is appropriate to use models and theory underpinned by observed systemic causal links, such as supply and demand determining price. On the other hand, where there is enough time for complexity to become influential, the system might be best explored using complexity science. This work explores the fundamental forces arising from trade in the long-run, where there is enough time for complexity forces to become influential. The complexity research tool used was agent-based modelling. A simple trade model was created that can be fully explained in just a few lines of prose. Three areas of the economy were explored using this model with the following results: 1) In complex systems, long-run prices are shaped by the system's definition of evolutionary fitness regardless of supply and demand. 2) Econophysicists are condtionally correct in their hypothesis that money in a closed system maintains a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution (0.5 Gini coefficient). 3) Experimentation with trade models support the Rand/Stonedahl experiments indicating that agent computational ability inversely correlates with efficiency. In addition to a simple trade model, a far more complex model was built that includes an environment with raw resources, agents who are labourers, business owners, and consumers. This model requires agents to successfully reproduce in order to avoid extinction. Almost all agent behaviour is governed by evolutionary variables. Using this model, it is also established that: 4) The behaviours established in simple trade model are maintained in a more complex model. 5) Long-term outcomes of economic models change as the nature of the population changes. 6) The nature of the economy can change the nature of the population. These last two points suggest that economic models using representative or eternal populations are not suitable for making conclusions concerning long-term economic theory or recommending policy. However, the most important finding is likely that price can be delinked from supply and demand in the long-run. Explanations for this result lie in the results of the other experiments that, together, build up our understanding of the foundational forces of trade in a complex system."

While expert knowledge on climate change percolates through political initiatives and public awareness, its translation into large-scale policy actions appears limited. Climate change consequences unequally target regions, countries and social classes, a vital issue for social cooperation. When facing an imminent ecological collapse, in which conditions can self-interested agents gain environmental awareness and settle on a sustainable path of actions when their knowledge of the imminent collapse is bounded? This cooperation emerges from the interaction between individuals and the interaction of various cognitive processes within individuals. This article develops an agent-based model for this emergence of cooperation enriched with the Agent Zero neurocognitive grounded cognitive architecture. We investigate when agents endowed with deliberative, affective and social modules can settle on actions that safeguard their environment through numerical simulations. Our results show that cooperation on sustainable actions is the strongest when the system is at the edge of collapse. Policy measures that increase the environment’s resilience become internalized by the agents and undermine awareness of the ecological catastrophe. Depending on the cognitive channels activated, agent behaviors and reactions to specific interventions significantly vary. Our analysis suggests that taking different cognitive channels, deliberative, affective, social, and others into account, significantly impact results. The complexity of agent cognition deserves more attention to assess parameter sensitivity in social simulation models."

This study presents an agent-based model capturing the behaviour of firms facing transport and supply disruptions due to natural disasters, and shows possible paths to reinforce infrastructure and supply chain resilience. Building resilience against shocks has become a pillar of sustainability. By understanding how the different components of an economy interact in times of crisis, we can design resilience strategies that go beyond building walls or dams. We formulate an original agent-based model to explore a crucial pathway through which a disaster affects the economy: the transport-supply chain nexus. The model simulates the behaviour of firms facing transport and supply disruptions and estimates the resulting indirect losses. As an illustration, the model is used to assess the criticality of Tanzanian roads, which are vulnerable to floods. We report three main results. First, the model generates maps that identify the transport infrastructure assets that are most critical for specific supply chains: roads that are most important for food security are different from those supporting international trade, for instance. Second, economic losses from transport disruptions increase non-linearly with the duration of disruptions, highlighting the benefit from fast repairs. Third, by combining economic and transport modelling, we can consider a broader spectrum of interventions. Beyond strengthening the transport system, it is also possible to make supply chains more resilient to disruption with, for instance, sourcing decisions or inventory management."

They usually have positive consequences for increasing economic exchanges, but negative ecological or health side effects. These negative effects are difficult to predict or even to understand due to the complexity of the system and of the number of involved processes. In this article, we focus on the Southeast Asia free trade area (the ASEAN) and specifically in the East-West economic corridor. A significant correlation has been observed in this area between the corridor opening and dengue fever cases, without being able to establish a causality relationship. We choose to tackle this issue by building an agent-based geographically explicit model. We propose an approach coupling dengue fever dynamics, climate data, economic mobility and health policies, following a design methodology decomposing these processes in sub-models and linking them to make one integrated model. In addition, we propose a way to deal with lack of data in the modeling process. Our simulation results show that there is influence of the increase in mobility and application of different control policies on the increase of dengue cases."

These methods called Economic-Environment Integrated Models (EEIM) are based on the coupling of formalised economic modelling tools with environmental assessment methods. The economic modelling tools considered are Input Output (IO) models, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and Partial Equilibrium (PE) models, Agent-Based models (ABM), and System Dynamics (SD) models, which we pair with environmental assessment methods such as Footprints (FP), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), or Material Flow Analysis (MFA). A grid of criteria is developed to perform a qualitative rating of the EEIMs according to existing literature. The grid encompasses the detail level of the economic modelling, the level of coupling between environmental and economic tools, the quality and diversity of indicators, the ability to account for diverse indirect effects, spatial differentiation, time aspects, and the coupled model usability. First, the results show that the couplings do not perform on the same criteria, which shows complementarity to deal with diverse issues. Second, overall, for most criteria, PE/CGE models coupled with FP/LCA ranked highest. Third, a few case studies showed that couplings involving a third tool can be beneficial— for instance AB modelling or MFA with PE/CGE-LCA/FP may allow to overcome some shortcomings such as agent behaviour modelling or data availability for biophysical flows. •Reviews couplings of 5 types of economic models and 3 environmental assessment tools.•Partial and Equilibrium models coupled with footprints methods and LCA rank well.•Building couplings involving a 3rd model addresses some shortcomings.•Scarcity of subnational scale data is a frequent obstacle."

(2019b, J. Econ. Dyn. Control, 101, 101–129). The model features a group of microfounded economies, with evolving industries, populated by heterogeneous firms that compete in international markets. In each country, technological change is driven by firms’ activities of search and innovation, while aggregate demand formation and distribution follow Keynesian dynamics. Interactions among countries take place via trade flows and international technological imitation. We employ the model to assess the different strategies that laggard countries can adopt to catch up with leaders: market-friendly policies; industrial policies targeting the development of firms’ capabilities and R&D investments, as well as trade restrictions for infant industry protection; protectionist policies focusing on tariffs only. We find that markets cannot do the magic: in absence of government interventions, laggards will continue to fall behind. On the contrary, industrial policies can successfully drive international convergence among leaders and laggards, while protectionism alone is not sufficient to support catching up and countries get stuck in a sort of middle-income trap. Finally, in a global trade war, where developed economies impose retaliatory tariffs, both laggards and leaders are worse off and world productivity growth slows down."
PalmerTomG2022DwDS,,"Development with Dignity: Self-determination, Localization, and the End to Poverty","Palmer, Tom G and Warner, Matt",2022,,1,,,,,Routledge,Milton,"At a time when the global development industry is under more pressure than ever before, this book argues that an end to poverty can only be achieved by prioritizing human dignity. Unable to adequately account for the roles of culture, context, and local institutions, today’s outsider-led development interventions continue to leave a trail of unintended consequences, ranging from wasteful to even harmful. This book shows that increased prosperity can only be achieved when people are valued as self-governing agents. Social orders that recognize autonomy and human dignity unleash enormous productive energy. This in turn leads to the mobilization of knowledge-sharing that is critical to innovation and localized problem-solving. Offering a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives and specific examples from the field showing these ideas in action, this book provides NGOs, multilateral institutions, and donor countries with practical guidelines for implementing """"dignity-first"""" development. Compelling and engaging, with a wide range of recommendations for reforming development practice and supporting liberal democracy, this book will be an essential read for students and practitioners of international development."

Important methodological impact for this has come in particular from scientists from Germany. Currently under construction, the SWISSland model claims to depict as realistically as possible the 50,000 family farms comprising the whole of Swiss agriculture in all their heterogeneity as regards farm and cost structures as well as farm decision behaviours, with the aim of improving the simulation and forecasting of structural change. This paper describes methodological aspects in the formation of the agent population by combining various data sources such as accounting and spatial data and the results of surveys. As its basis, SWISSland uses the 3300 Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) farms, whose representativeness is substantially improved by means of a corrective procedure. Individual-farm optimisation models simulate the heterogeneous behaviour of the agents, for whom a potential exists for land trade within regional groups. With the linking of different methods and recorded data, we can expect to see a marked increase in the quality of the assessment of policy consequences."

LiuYang2012Mico,,Modelling industrial construction operations using a multi-agent resource allocation framework,"Liu, Yang and Mohamed, Yasser",2012,"Engineering, construction, and architectural management",19,4,406-427,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,Purpose - Modelling construction resources and their dynamic interactions and constraints are a challenging problem. The allocation of these resources to competing activities is usually a function required in any scheduling process. Performing such allocation under a dynamic and diverse set of constraints adds more complexity to the problem. This study seeks a structured approach for representing resources and their allocation to different activities through the use of an agent-oriented modelling framework.Design methodology approach - A model is developed for a real case of assembly operations of industrial construction modules. The model follows a multi-agent resource allocation structure and is implemented within an agent-based simulation environment. The model is used to evaluate the effects of different optimization algorithms and modelling parameters on the generation of a construction schedule. Different experiments run through the model and their results are analyzed and discussed.Findings - The model showed sensitivity only under large and continuous workloads. Overall the structured approach followed in developing the model provided a flexible medium for experimenting with different elements of the resource allocation problem.Research limitations implications - The work is limited to the studied case and the results cannot be generalized beyond similar cases. The modelling approach used in the study provides a platform that can facilitate future research in construction resource allocation strategies.Originality value - The presented work demonstrates a new approach for modelling construction resource allocation problems that enables structured experimentation with alternative allocation algorithms. It also presents a novel way for modelling modular industrial construction operations.

This may actually not be a new paradigm but it may be necessary to go back in time to make the valuation models that are used more realistic and to try to include the realities that there are many diverse actors in the real estate marketplace and their actions are important and should not be assumed away. Behavior matters and the models for pricing real estate need to take this into account.Design methodology approach - The paper examines some of the emerging models in other disciplines and works to relate them to the real estate marketplace in general but, more importantly, to help to explain the most recent bust of the global real estate markets.Findings - The paper finds that there is a need to consider an alternative paradigm for the valuation of real estate and complexity theory as well as the adaptive system models that specifically take into account that the various actors in a real estate marketplace could be used to help better explain the emergent nature of real estate values.Originality value - This is the first paper to one's knowledge that argues for a shift in thinking to include complexity economics and agent-based modeling as potential solutions to gain a better understanding of how real estate markets react."

It identifies actions, mechanisms and partnerships and builds on existing government policies, industry and community initiatives for the purpose of ""halting and reversing the decline in water quality entering the Reef within 10 years"" through ""reducing the load of pollutants from diffuse sources in the water entering the Reef"". A range of different indicators proposed for the nine strategies of the plan define policy goals that require an integrated assessment of the Great Barrier Reef region. In this context and under given uncertainties in regard to policy outcomes, decision support systems can help simulate the impact of potential policy options. Policy options involving water quantity and water quality questions and the underlying context of land use require an understanding of environmental, economic and social consequences. This paper presents an approach developed for the GBR region, which employs a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and an agent-based model (ABM) for integrated policy impact assessment. This applied modelling approach shows that strengths of different modelling techniques can be combined to support water policy decision making more effectively. This paper is focused on integration in the form of policy process and research response regarding model design on two system scales that provide cross scale decision support."

In this paper, we report on the development and results of an agent-based model of the migration dynamics that may arise in Bangladesh as a result of climate change. The main modules are each calibrated with data on relevant indicators, such as the incidences of extreme poverty, socioeconomic vulnerability, demography, and historical drought, cyclone and flood patterns. The results suggest likely changes in population densities across Bangladesh due to migration from the drought-prone western districts and areas vulnerable to cyclones and floods in the south, towards northern and eastern districts. The model predicts between 3 and 10 million internal migrants over the next 40 years, depending on the severity of the hazards. Some associated policy considerations are also discussed."

Countries contribute proportionally to their GDP, whereas funds are redistributed according to a mechanism that gives more funds to countries performing worse than the average of the Union in cyclical terms. Our simulations show that an IFTU inspired by such a redistribution principle acts as a stabilizer of international trade, allowing us to stabilize and improve the Union GDP performance without affecting the stability of public finances. When the Union is allowed to borrow on capital markets, i.e. in a Fully Fledged Fiscal Transfer Union (FFFTU), these effects are enhanced and a part of the public debt burden shifts from the national to the Union level, leaving the total burden almost stable. An interesting result to assess the political acceptability of the proposal is that ""core"" countries eventually benefit the most from the introduction of this mechanism, despite being more frequently net contributors. Finally, we show that an FFFTU with common debt might help to soften the impact of an exogenous demand shock, while, because of the fact that it mainly operates as a stabilizer of aggregate demand, it does not seem to provide beneficial effects when facing a supply shock to production."

This paper offers an alternative modelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied Mark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to plausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of economic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence of regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous shocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a production/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply chain shock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions about monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various explanations for the resurgence of inflation in the USA, including demand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are fourfold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take years to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; (ii) the success of monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring, rather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii) however, perhaps paradoxically, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and unemployment, leading to a narrow window of ""optimal"" policy responses due to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment; (iv) the two most sensitive model parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of our study have implications for Central Bank decision-making, and offer an easy-to-use tool that may help anticipate the consequences of different monetary and fiscal policies."

Part A, Policy and practice",148,,262-285,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"•A data-driven agent-based model compared charging station roll-out strategies.•Increasing size, due to return to scale effects result in utilisation efficiency.•Policy makers face a trade-off between providing accessibility & convenience.•Mixed roll-out strategies (Level 2, hubs, Fast) satisfies EV driver demand best. On the eve of the large-scale introduction of electric vehicles, policy makers have to decide on how to organise a significant growth in charging infrastructure to meet demand. There is uncertainty about which charging deployment tactic to follow. The main issue is how many of charging stations, of which type, should be installed and where. Early roll-out has been successful in many places, but knowledge on how to plan a large-scale charging network in urban areas is missing. Little is known about return to scale effects, reciprocal effects of charger availability on sales, and the impact of fast charging or more clustered charging hubs on charging preferences of EV owners. This paper explores the effects of various roll-out strategies for charging infrastructure that facilitate the large-scale introduction of EVs, using agent-based simulation. In contrast to previously proposed models, our model is rooted in empirically observed charging patterns from EVs instead of travel patterns of fossil fuelled cars. In addition, the simulation incorporates different user types (inhabitants, visitors, taxis and shared vehicles) to model the diversity of charging behaviours in an urban environment. Different scenarios are explored along the lines of the type of charging infrastructure (level 2, clustered level 2, fast charging) and the intensity of rollout (EV to charging point ratio). The simulation predicts both the success rate of charging attempts and the additional discomfort when searching for a charging station. Results suggest that return to scale and reciprocal effects in charging infrastructure are considerable, resulting in a lower EV to charging station ratio on the longer term."
YamamotoRyuichi2022PCIT,,"Predictor Choice, Investor Types, and the Price Impact of Trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange","Yamamoto, Ryuichi",2022,Computational economics,59,1,325-356,,,Springer US,New York,"Several agent-based theoretical models demonstrate that the fundamental or trend-following predictor, or the dynamic predictor selection between them, is the main generator of price deviation from fundamental value. However, little research has empirically attempted to determine which theory has the most explanatory power on the empirical phenomenon. This study empirically identifies which predictor is most commonly utilized by actual investors and causes the empirical feature. We identify that life or postal life insurance entities, trust banks, industrial corporations, and other corporations (branches of foreign companies located in Japan or corporations related to governments, employee stock ownership, or labor unions) interchangeably switch fundamental and technical rules over time. We also find individual investors, security companies, and investment trusts to be fundamentalists, while foreign investors are trend-followers, and investors involved in proprietary trading and other financial institutions are contrarians. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all the investors in our sample have experienced a significant price impact in their trades. Our findings provide broad support for several types of agent-based models for the generation of the empirical feature in financial markets. In addition, trust banks—considered long-term investors—use a dynamic predictor selection between fundamental and technical rules but use a contrarian strategy for their technical rule. Meanwhile, trend-following foreign investors—the most active investors in our sample—are usually short-term. Therefore, our evidence on the price impact of their trades is consistent with the finding in Fama and French (J Finance 57: 637–659, 2002) that price momentum persists in the short and medium terms but reverses in the long term. We demonstrate our result by using a unique panel dataset on order flows by investor type from the Tokyo Stock Exchange that covers 87% of the total market volume."

In particular, we study the impact of the imposition of minimum resting times, of circuit breakers, of cancellation fees and of transaction taxes on asset price volatility and on the occurrence and the duration of flash crashes. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that HFT-targeted policies imply a trade-off between market stability and resilience. Indeed, we find that policies able to tackle volatility and flash crashes also hinder the market from quickly recovering after a crash. This result is mainly due to the dual role of HFT, as both a cause of flash crashes and a key player in the post-crash recovery."

These include properties related to returns (leptokurtosis, absence of linear autocorrelation, volatility clustering), trading volumes (volume clustering, correlation between volume and volatility), and timing of trades (number of price changes, autocorrelation of durations between subsequent trades, heavy tails in their distribution, order-side clustering). Our model combines heterogeneous boundedly rational agents, endogenously activating on the basis of market events, with realistic assumptions on market microstructure. In particular, we introduce a strict event scheduling borrowed from the Euronext exchange. We study the model in a bottom-up fashion under alternative scenarios regarding the sophistication of agents’ strategies. These scenarios allow us to disentangle the role of microstructure characteristics from trading behaviour in the emergence of market statistical properties. Our results reveal that traders’ endogenous activation is crucial to jointly reproduce most of these properties. The ability of the model to replicate the main stylised facts of financial markets proves that it can be fruitfully used by policymakers as a test-bed for regulatory experiments aimed at improving market outcomes at different time-scales."

The model offers insights into how to set parameters in a PM and how profits react to contrasting settings and AMMs. In addition, we simulate different probability processes, distinct AMMs, and agent behaviors. This paper also utilizes the LMSR-ASM to evaluate the impact of choosing initial prices in profits and revenue opportunities regarding AMM computational implementation. We show that we can use the LMSR-ASM to find optimal parameters for maximizing profits in PMs and how different AMMs affect market results under a variety of settings."

When examining entrepreneurship ecosystems, we find that the composition of a region influences the new knowledge acquired by the venture. The main aim of this study is to examine the influence of the new venture, the entrepreneur’s social capital, and the firm performance on the new venture’s knowledge acquisition activities. In particular, the study examines how the institutional context of a region influences new ventures’ knowledge acquisition actions during its growth, and in turn the level of sustained entrepreneurial activity within the region. The paper focuses on the formation of alliances by new ventures, one particular form of knowledge acquisition process that has been established as critical to new venture success in the high technology sector. The mechanisms for acquiring and transforming knowledge have the greatest impact on new venture formation, and in this context, the concepts of strategic knowledge arbitrage and strategic knowledge serendipity (SKARSE™) are validated through an agent-based simulation model. The main results focus on the effects of interactions between entrepreneurs and institutions in the process of new venture formation from a knowledge creation, dissemination, and absorption perspective."

cdi_springer_books_10_1007_978_3_319_47039_9_2,,Two Approaches to Modelling Trade,"Medda, Francesca Romana and Caravelli, Francesco and Caschili, Simone and Wilson, Alan",,,,,25-Nov,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,"As mentioned in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-47039-9_1, our two case studies have some similarities as we will see, but they differ in scale. The SPICs case calls for an outward looking perspective and the scale is extensive; whereas Uganda is inward looking and demands a micro-scale of analysis. For the outward looking perspective of the South Pacific Islands we adopt network theory and a spatial interaction approach (Jackson 2008; Wilson 2008) through which we examine how trade is influenced by cumulative network interactions. The twofold interpretation of the cumulative network concept involves (1) representing the shipping network system; in this sense, elements are aggregated in categories whose combinations help to describe the complete network system; and (2) accounting for the vertical and horizontal interactions within the system. The inward looking perspective of Uganda uses agent based modelling (ABM) (Epstein 2006). ABMs are a class of model applied widely in agriculture economics (Happe et al. 2006; Berger 2001; Balmann 1997, 1999). The advantages of this methodology are that it allows us to employ data from different sources and different groups of heterogeneous agents who interact; exchange of information ensues and the adaptive behaviour responses to accommodate changes in the environment are taken into the model. Both of our selected modelling approaches, network theory and spatial interaction on the one hand, and agent based modelling on the other, can handle positive and negative feedback. Given that trade theory warns us of the importance of information asymmetry as an established factor that can hinder trade and limit growth, we also introduce a new concept based on information exchange. This new concept is operationalised through the multiplier attachment factor. In the next sections we set out the details of our two approaches."

We study the dynamics of the model by means of computer simulation. Some macroeconomic properties emerge such as endogenous business cycles, nominal GDP growth, unemployment rate fluctuations, the Phillips curve, leverage cycles and credit constraints, bank defaults and financial instability, and the importance of government as an acyclical sector which stabilize the economy. The model highlights that even extended crises can endogenously emerge. In these cases, the system may remain trapped in a large unemployment status, without the possibility to quickly recover unless an exogenous intervention takes place."

We analyze model output using a series of macro-scale economic and landscape pattern measures, including land rent gradients estimated using simple regression models. We first demonstrate that our model replicates relevant theoretical results of the traditional Alonso/Von Thunen model (structural validation). We then explore how urban morphology and land rents change as the relative market power of buyers and sellers changes (i.e., we move from a 'sellers' market' to a 'buyers' market'). We demonstrate that these strategic price dynamics have differential effects on land rents, but both lead to increased urban expansion."

Economists usually rely on random explorations, such as Monte Carlo simulations, and basic econometric modeling to approximate the properties of computational models. This paper aims to provide guidelines for the use of a much more efficient method that combines a parsimonious sampling of the parameter space using a specific design of experiments (DoE) , with a well-suited metamodeling method first developed in geostatistics: kriging . We illustrate these guidelines by following them in the analysis of two simple and well known economic models: Nelson and Winter’s industrial dynamics model, and Cournot oligopoly with learning firms. In each case, we show that our DoE experiments can catch the main effects of the parameters on the models’ dynamics with a much lower number of simulations than the Monte-Carlo sampling (e.g. 85 simulations instead of 2,000 in the first case). In the analysis of the second model, we also introduce supplementary numerical tools that may be combined with this method, for characterizing configurations complying with a specific criterion (social optimal, replication of stylized facts, etc.). Our appendix gives an example of the R-project code that can be used to apply this method on other models, in order to encourage other researchers to quickly test this approach on their models."

The ITC process is analysed within an Agent-Based Stock-Flow Consistent (AB-SFC) model, wherein credit-constrained heterogeneous firms choose both the intensity and the direction of innovation towards a labour- or capital-saving choice of technique. In the long-run, the model reproduces the so-called ‘Kaldor stylised facts’ (i.e. a purely labour-saving technical change process), however during the transitional phase the model shows a labour-saving/capital-using innovation pattern, as the aggregate output-capital ratio decreases until it stabilises in the long-run, and the labour share persistently decline as observed during the last decades in many advanced (and developing) economies. Within the present model, we can ascribe these results mainly to the effect exerted by the interplay between directed and biased technical change, the process of wage formation and the dynamics of aggregate demand. In order to stress the effective role of the innovation bias on the model dynamics, the baseline scenario has been compared with a ‘counterfactual’ scenario wherein ‘neutral’ technical progress is at work. The main findings are also confirmed by computing a sensitivity investigation on the key parameters shaping innovation and wage formation process."

These actions had direct repercussions on the economy as well as essential institutions in society; however, there were also indirect effects from these changes. This article focuses on these indirect consequences on the environment’s sustainability. It demonstrates that the net effect has been good in terms of reduced carbon gases, oil exploration operations, and pollution. This study introduces a novel approach to predicting and simulating the pandemic’s dynamics in Morocco using machine learning and multi-agent system models. We collected and processed daily data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and interventions in Morocco from March 2, 2020, to June 30, 2021. We developed and validated several machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to predict daily COVID-19 cases and deaths. Additionally, we designed a multi-agent system model to simulate the interactions among individuals, social groups, and the government in response to the pandemic, using agent-based modelling and game theory. Our results indicate that the machine learning models achieved high accuracy and generalization performance, with an average R-squared value of 0.83 for the cases and 0.90 for the deaths. The multi-agent simulations reveal the complex dynamics and trade-offs among pandemic control measures, economic activity, and social welfare in Morocco, suggesting that a coordinated and adaptive approach is necessary to balance these factors. Our study contributes to the growing literature on using machine learning and multiagent systems for pandemic prediction and management, providing valuable insights and recommendations for policymakers and public health officials in Morocco and beyond."

It summarizes and discusses the results of a 5-year research project carried out by the editors that aimed to apply spatial dynamical modelling to reconstruct and understand the socio-economic development of the Dutch part of the Roman frontier (limes) zone, in particular the agrarian economy and the related development of settlement patterns and transport networks in the area. The project papers are accompanied by invited chapters presenting case studies and reflections from other parts of the Roman Empire focusing on the themes of subsistence economy, demography, transport and mobility, and socio-economic networks in the Roman period. The book shows the added value of state-of-the-art computer modelling techniques and bridges computational and conventional approaches. Topics that will be of particular interest to archaeologists are the question of (forced) surplus production, the demographic and economic effects of the Roman occupation on the local population, and the structuring of transport networks and settlement patterns. For modellers, issues of sensitivity analysis and validation of modelling results are specifically addressed. This book will appeal to students and researchers working in the computational humanities and social sciences, in particular, archaeology and ancient history."

The main objective of this work is to implement an agent‐based model that simulates complex stock markets. Similar existing simulation models address the buying and selling of assets but do not investigate the information exchange process. We extend the previous model by investigating the information exchange process during the transaction process. In this research, we simulate an asynchronous marketplace where interacting and heterogeneous agents exchange information and assets simultaneously. We study the effect of heterogeneous and cumulative information setup on the volume of transactions and the price dynamics during market sessions. We argue that the right interpretation of relevant information is conducive to rational decision‐making by the simulated agents. Our simulation shows that stock market results are sensitive to the type of information about agents. Our model will enhance the exchange decisions in the markets, which will lead to more efficiency."

Yet wine grapes are not native to France. Additionally, wine was not developed indigenously first. In the 7th century B.C. Etruscan merchants bringing wine landed on the shores of the Languedoc and established trade relationships with the native Gauls, later creating local viticulture, and laying the foundation for a strong cultural identity of French wine production and setting in motion a multi-billion dollar industry. This paper examines the first five centuries of wine consumption (from similar to 600 B.C. to similar to 100 B.C.), analyzing how preference of one type of luxury good over another created distinctive artifact patterns in the archaeological record. I create a simple agent-based model to examine how the trade of comestibles for wine led to a growing economy and a distinctive patterning of artifacts in the archaeological record of southern France. This model helps shed light on the processes that led to centuries of peaceable relationships with colonial merchants, and interacts with scholarly debate on why Etruscan amphorae are replaced by Greek amphorae so swiftly and completely."

The family business was considered to be such a company in which members of one family hold at least two strategic management functions. There were used questionnaire surveys in order to obtain detailed data from individual firms. Data were then transferred to the SPSS program, subjected to the primary analysis and correlation analysis. Characteristics of family businesses were used as inputs for the NetLogo agent-based simulation. Agent-based models can be applied in numerous problem domains, typically in computer science, biology or medicine. In case of economy, agent metaphor can be used for modelling companies, decision makers, employees, customers etc. acting in the market. Our agent-based model allowed us to observe developmental stages of two abstract companies: family business and non-family business. The simulation enables experimenting with different settings of parameters (independent variables) that describe companies. The objective of the simulation was to identify the differences between the family and non-family businesses in sense of the Greiner's theory of the organization growth. The agent-based simulation results showed that family businesses in the first phase of their development grow in terms of amounts of asset and sales. This grow is faster than grow of non-family businesses. The break occurs at the stage of leadership crisis, where family businesses are starting to lag in size behind the non-family businesses. Our findings of the simulation experiments correspond with the findings in the area of family businesses research made in other European countries and in the USA."
ZhaoMiyuan2013ITMf,,Inventory-based Temporal Modeling for Freight Networks,"Zhao, Miyuan",2013,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Freight transportation demand is a highly variable process over time and space. Two challenges in current regional freight forecasting are the lack of consideration of the space-time trade-offs and the lack of behaviorally-based models for temporally assigning annual commodity flows to daily flows. State-of-the-practice models typically use fixed factors for temporal assignment and do not address the tradeoffs between transport costs and inventory costs, which can aid in quantifying the impact of different land uses on monthly truck distributions or the impact of rising fuel costs on shipment frequency and warehousing needs. This dissertation work makes the first step toward explicitly modeling the freight temporal distributions and proposes a novel approach that adopts the concept of Network Economics and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) inventory in an agent-based freight demand modeling framework. Unlike other agent-based models that seek to replace the whole freight forecasting process, the proposed model relies on other aggregate models to generate annual distribution channels (commodity OD matrix) and monthly demand distributions by commodity type. This frees the model to focus on trade-offs between transport and inventory without having to bear the burden of limited disaggregate data for other choices. The modeling framework is composed of two main components: (1) a supplier selection module to indicate the supply chain interactions and determine the order quantity from one firm to another firm while meeting the zone level flow constraints; (2) an EOQ-based inventory operation module to indicate the goods movement daily pattern and determine the daily firm-firm flows by modeling firms' inventory replenishment decisions. By aggregating the daily firm-firm flows back up to the zone level, we get the average zone-zone daily flows by commodity types as the final output. The whole framework has been fully examined using the California data. A union of 6 datasets is utilized as inputs to model the daily flows of 503 firm groups in California during the 261 weekdays in year 2007. As one parameter of the normative model, the unit inventory holding cost has been calibrated with the given inventory data. A simple comparison of the model outputs with the fixed factor approach is conducted. Four use cases are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of such a new model for freight transport analysis."

This paper delivers three main outcomes. First, we identify key criteria for analyzing current ESMs and we describe seven current and future low-carbon energy system modeling challenges: the increasing need for flexibility, further electrification, emergence of new technologies, technological learning and efficiency improvements, decentralization, macroeconomic interactions, and the role of social behavior in the energy system transition. These criteria are then translated into required modeling capabilities such as the need for hourly temporal resolution, sectoral coupling technologies (e.g., P2X), technological learning, flexibility technologies, stakeholder behavior, cross border trade, and linking with macroeconomic models. Second, a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) is used as a framework to identify modeling gaps while clarifying high modeling capabilities of MARKAL, TIMES, REMix, PRIMES, and METIS. Third, to bridge major energy modeling gaps, two conceptual modeling suites are suggested, based on both optimization and simulation methodologies, in which the integrated ESM is hard-linked with a regional model and an energy market model and soft-linked with a macroeconomic model. •Seven low-carbon energy system modeling challenges are described.•Multi-Criteria Analysis is used as a framework to identify modeling gaps.•Some potential solutions to address the ESM gaps are briefly discussed.•Two conceptual modeling suites are suggested to bridge major energy modeling gaps."

Modelling the Kenyan Floricultural Sector,"Calisti, Roberto and Holtmaat, Ellen Alexandra",2021,"Earth (Basel, Switzerland)",2,4,871-893,,,Mdpi,BASEL,"This study simultaneously addresses two issues: (a) defining what counts as 'small farms' in the rose sector, taking the geographical and socioeconomic context into account and (b) whether the requests for certification form barriers for small farms. We focus on small farms, as they are of fundamental importance for social and economic development and significantly contribute to the environmental sustainability of agriculture and land use. An agent-based model is used for analyzing an agricultural production and supply chain. The model identifies the minimum farm size needed to cover increased costs due to sustainability certifications. The model is applied to the case study of rose production in Kenya. Kenya is one of the world's leading flower producers. Almost all Kenya's floricultural production is exported, and the export of stem roses accounts for about 80% by weight of Kenya's floricultural exports. Environmental and social sustainability certification is increasingly required for farms, especially those in developing countries that want to export their products. Our findings suggest that sustainability standards disadvantage small Kenyan rose farms and constitute a further obstacle to their entry into the international rose market. In this specific context, standards limit market access for farms smaller than 4 hectares. The agent-based model proposed in this study can be adjusted to help determine the definition of 'small farms' in need of extra support in other sectors."

This paper describes the ensuing agent-based model for analyzing the vulnerability of the financial system to asset- and funding-based fire sales. The model captures the dynamic interactions of agents in the financial system extending from the suppliers of funding through the intermediation and transformation functions of the bank/dealers to the financial institutions that use the funds to trade in the asset markets. The model replicates the key finding that it is the reaction to initial losses, rather than the losses themselves, that determine the extent of a crisis. By building on a detailed mapping of the transformations and dynamics of the financial system, the agent-based model provides an avenue toward risk management that can illuminate the pathways for the propagation of key crisis dynamics such as fire sales and funding runs."

This search entails the analysis and prediction of extreme events in housing and mortgage markets. Design/methodology/approach – The focus of this paper concerns efforts to assess the likelihood and consequences of extreme and consequential economic events prior to their occurrence. The goal is to assess the criticism offered by Taleb that economists overstate the understanding of extreme events. One piece of evidence consists of a case study of the literature and policies regarding capital adequacy for financial institutions who invest in residential mortgages. The other is a review of recent literature about the crisis that offers similar conclusions. Findings – The evidence suggests that the criticism is valid. The case study reviews a number of areas in which the search for capital adequacy reflected the traits of black swan blindness as described by Taleb. The review of the recent literature about the crisis highlights a number of papers that reach similar conclusions. These include high level overviews of the literature on the crisis, e.g. Lo, a number of papers that specifically focus on housing and mortgage markets, and some very recent work about agent based modeling and complexity theory presented at the 2012 ARES meetings. Research limitations/implications – The conclusion suggests a number of ways in which economists can combat the potential of black swan blindness is our search for extreme events. One suggestion is to combat the error of confirmation with ongoing testing. Combating overly simplistic narratives can also be addressed by listening more carefully to the criticisms by people outside the field. Pay more attention to silent evidence by having more substantial and ongoing consumer testing of new products, more work to identify best practices, and more resources to enforce lending laws. Finally, more attention needs to be focused upon assumptions in the models that are based upon limited empirical evidence and, if found later to be false, may lead to dire outcomes. Practical implications – These include more and ongoing evaluation of stress tests. New rules to adjust capital requirements over the business cycle are consistent with the suggestions of the paper. Economists need to spend more time exploring and learning from outliers in the models. Social implications – The recent crisis has been driven by a wide variety of factors from within many sectors and agents. The outcome has been a major problem for people in many sectors and regions of the economy. The hope is that economists can do a better job in the future to help policymakers and others be more prepared for the potential of extreme events in the hopes of avoiding them in the future or at least reducing their likelihood and damage caused by them. Originality/value – The paper draws upon a wide variety of literature to establish its main points. Central to it is a review of an issue on which the author had substantial experience – academic and professional – and that also played a major role in the crisis – inadequate capital for an extreme downturn in house prices."

Here, we use an agent-based model to explore the potential impacts of the tradeoff between police spending and social welfare spending on crime by including parameters for heteroge-neous hardship and views of police legitimacy in the model. The purpose of the model is to attempt to explain those mixed results and to provide guidance for policymakers who are implementing these funding decisions. We find that by including the hardship of the people and their view of police legitimacy in the model, the impact of increasing police spending has diminishing returns on the crime rate and under certain circumstances can lead to an increase in crime. This is a stepping stone for future models which can model systems in even more detail. Additionally, policymakers may want to incorporate hardship and police legitimacy into their decision analysis when evaluating programs and budgets."

The analysis of ARV price evolution and market dynamics in Brazil can help anticipate issues soon to afflict other developing countries, as the 2010 revision of the World Health Organization guidelines shifts demand towards more expensive treatments, and, at the same time, current evolution of international legislation and trade agreements on intellectual property rights may reduce availability of generic drugs for HIV care. Methods and Findings: Our analyses are based on effective prices paid for ARV procurement in Brazil between 1996 and 2009. Data panel structure was exploited to gather ex-ante and ex-post information and address various sources of statistical bias. In-difference estimation offered in-depth information on ARV market characteristics which significantly influence prices. Although overall ARV prices follow a declining trend, changing characteristics in the generic segment help explain recent increase in generic ARV prices. Our results show that generic suppliers are more likely to respond to factors influencing demand size and market competition, while originator suppliers tend to set prices strategically to offset compulsory licensing threats and generic competition. Significance: In order to guarantee the long term sustainability of access to antiretroviral treatment, our findings highlight the importance of preserving and stimulating generic market dynamics to sustain developing countries' bargaining power in price negotiations undertaken with originator companies."

However, water use systems, whether actively governed or not, involve multiple, independent decision makers with diverse and often conflicting interests. In the absence of adequate water management institutions to effectively coordinate decision processes on water use, water users' behaviors are rather likely to be non-cooperative, meaning that actions by individual users generate externalities and lead to sub-optimal water use efficiency. The objective of this review is to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of recently proposed modeling systems dealing with non-cooperative water use regarding their ability to realistically represent the features of complex hydrological and socioeconomic processes and their tractability in terms of modeling tools and computational efficiency. For that purpose, we conducted a systematic review of 47 studies that address non-cooperative water use in decentralized modeling approaches. Even though such a decentralized approach should aim to model decisions by individual water users in non-cooperative water use, we find that most studies assumed the presence of a coordinating agency or market in their model. It also turns out that most of these models employed a solution procedure that sequentially solved independent economic decisions based on pre-defined conditions and heuristics, while only few modeling approaches offered simultaneous solution algorithms. We argue that this approach cannot adequately capture economic trade-offs in resource allocation, in contrast to models with simultaneous solution procedures."

In this paper, we introduce an agent-based simulation approach as a means for exploring and analyzing the impact of (combinations of) multi-channel activities on customer channel choices before having implemented them in practice. The simulation takes into account the heterogeneity of customers, social dynamics in their behavior, and the various phases of the purchasing process. To this end, customers are represented by agents whose phase-specific channel perceptions determine their channel choices. These perceptions may be altered by communication with other agents, first-hand experience of the channel, and/or marketing activities. The approach is illustrated through a sample application for which data from an international multi-channel retailer as well as from an empirical study among Austrian customers have been used."

The incentive and supervision are effective means to improve the performance of innovation. The purpose of this paper is to propose appropriate incentive and supervision mechanisms to reduce information asymmetry and improve the efficiency of incentives. Suggestions on technological innovation are put forward to megaprojects management.Design/methodology/approachAccording to the principal-agent theory, the research develops incentive models under three states, i.e. information symmetry, information asymmetry and information asymmetry based on supervision mechanism. The Bayesian theory is employed to prove the effectiveness of the novel supervision method based on risk assessment.FindingsThe results indicate that under the information asymmetry, the incentive intensity is positively correlated with the social benefits coefficient, and negatively correlated with the patent benefits coefficient. The R&D effort and the owner's incentive intensity decline with the increase of information asymmetry. The supervision of risks can effectively reduce the degree of information asymmetry, and the higher the uncertainty of innovations, the more significant the effect of supervision is. As the supervision intensity increases, the incentive intensity, the R&D effort and the innovation output will increase. In addition, the R&D institutions with high innovation capability, low unit cost of R&D and low risk-aversion are more willing to make efforts to innovate.Originality/valueThis study fills the research gap on incentive and supervision of technological innovation in megaprojects. The externality of innovation benefits is considered in the model. The traditional incentive model is extended through the introduction of supervision. Furthermore, a novel supervision method based on risk assessment is proposed. The results validate the importance of risk management in technological innovation and provide a new insight for project management."

We argue that these dimensions affect the way in which empirical validation is carried out by AB modelers and we critically discuss the main alternative approaches to empirical validation being developed in AB economics. We conclude by focusing on a set of (as yet) unresolved issues for empirical validation that require future research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Fifteen years later, Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have experienced a significant economic growth, mostly based upon industrial development and trade expansion, displaying a strong integration in EU global value chains. In this paper, we aim to analyse if this process of economic and commercial integration has also triggered the externalization of environmental pressures towards Central and Eastern Europe or, on the contrary, trade expansion has been accompanied with a significant technological and structural change in these countries, offsetting the potential scale effects associated to the export growth. To that aim, we use an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model with information from 2000 to 2016 that will allow us to quantify the PM2.5 emissions embodied in intra-European trade flows. As a second step, we develop a Structural Decomposition Analysis to evaluate the factors driving emissions embodied in exports from CEE to Western EU countries. •This paper analyses PM2.5 emissions embodied in trade within EU countries.•We focus on the relationship between CEE and Western EU economies during 2000–2016.•We use multiregional input-output modelling and structural decomposition analysis.•Emissions embodied in exports fell, but the trend reversed by 2012.•Specialization patterns and efficiency are key to explain the change in emissions."

The understanding of such dynamics is important to simulate future land-use demand, which is an essential input for land-use modelling applications. The rigorous estimation of demand for industrial and commercial land is also important to support planning policies and decisions, which aim at allocating scarce land resources efficiently. This study uses regional data from 1990 and 2000 to investigate potential driving factors of industrial/commercial land demand for France, and 2012 data for model validation concerning the projections of land demand. A static model and a change model are specified based on the supply and demand relationship of the regional industrial/commercial land market in France. The estimated models indicate that regional characteristics of location and area, mineral resources and infrastructure, and socio-economic factors are critical to understanding industrial/commercial land developments. From regression analysis, static models show better performance over land-use change models in both the estimation and model validation stages. The change models are biased towards unobserved variables and time-lag effects of the changes in explanatory variables. The use of regression approaches is a valuable tool to explore the factors underlying industrial and commercial expansion at regional level, but their usage for long-term projections is subject to high uncertainties."

Market microstructure studies of intraday trading patterns have established that there is a regular pattern of high volumes near both the open and close of the trading day. O’Hara (1995) points out the many difficulties in specifying all the necessary elements of a strategic model for determining and attaining an equilibrium describing intraday patterns. We develop an autonomous agent-based market microstructure simulation with both informed agents and uninformed liquidity-motivated agents. Both types of agents can learn when to trade, but are zero-intelligence on all other behavior. We do not impose an equilibrium concept but instead look for emergent behavior. Our results demonstrate that trading patterns can arise in such a model as a result of interactions between informed and uninformed agents even though the agents are non-strategic and not fully rational. As long as there is rudimentary social or individual learning, uninformed liquidity-motivated agents can coordinate to avoid trading with informed agents and suffering adverse selection losses. The extent and pattern of coordination between uninformed agents depends on the learning specification, the percentage of informed agents and the degree of cooperation/competition among the informed agents."

Our model captures a complex market environment for a single security, whose common value is given by a dynamic fundamental time series. Agents trade through a limit-order book, based on their private values and noisy observations of the fundamental. We consider background agents following two types of trading strategies: the non-spoofable zero intelligence (ZI) that ignores the order book and the manipulable heuristic belief learning (HBL) that exploits the order book to predict price outcomes. We conduct empirical game-theoretic analysis upon simulated agent payoffs across parametrically different environments and measure the effect of spoofing on market performance in approximate strategic equilibria. We demonstrate that HBL traders can benefit price discovery and social welfare, but their existence in equilibrium renders a market vulnerable to manipulation: simple spoofing strategies can effectively mislead traders, distort prices and reduce total surplus. Based on this model, we propose to mitigate spoofing from two aspects: (1) mechanism design to disincentivize manipulation; and (2) trading strategy variations to improve the robustness of learning from market information. We evaluate the proposed approaches, taking into account potential strategic responses of agents, and characterize the conditions under which these approaches may deter manipulation and benefit market welfare. Our model provides a way to quantify the effect of spoofing on trading behavior and market efficiency, and thus it can help to evaluate the effectiveness of various market designs and trading strategies in mitigating an important form of market manipulation."

After arguing that such tools should necessarily tackle criticality at a complex level, in particular on multiple scales (e.g., France and the EU), we present the first thematic and methodological discussions of our results from the ongoing design of a methodologically based simulation model on two subfields of artificial intelligence: agent-based computational economics (ACE) and machine learning (ML). In applying this to cobalt, our model aims to assess a supply shortage in France for prospective purposes. More precisely, we model a first individual agent (which is already complex by itself) acting at a country level: France. This model is not yet an ACE model per se since only one agent is designed. Nonetheless, we include ACE in the discussions since the work is a premise of such an end. The discussions also include how well the field accepts the methodology. At a thematic level, our preliminary prospective conclusion is a French cobalt supply shortage, should the case arise, would not be due to the variation of price from the UK, the transit leader of cobalt export to France. At a methodological level, we think the idea of methodologically coupling ML and ACE is necessary. ML is well-known in this field, but mainly for the study of mineral prospectivity in mining. Conversely, ACE covers the value chain but is not yet well known in the field and as such is still not trusted."

We aimed to develop a quantitative benefit-risk analysis to assess whether the resulting increase in the uncertainty in the clinical performance of biosimilars (i.e. risk) may be countered by their lower pricing (benefit). Methods A 1-year decision-analytic model was developed for the biosimilar infliximab (Inflectra ® ) for Crohn’s disease. The perspective was that of the National Health Service in the UK and costs were valued to 2015/16. A hypothetical cohort of biologic-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease was simulated through the model. Immunogenicity to infliximab was a key modifier, influencing rates of non-response and infusion reactions. Net health benefit was estimated based on quality-adjusted life-years. A range of sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results and explored how the biosimilar price must respond to varying immunogenicity to remain the preferred option. Results The base-case analysis predicted a positive incremental net health benefit of 0.04 (95% central range 0.00–0.09) favouring the biosimilar, based on 0.803 quality-adjusted life-years, and costs of £18,087 and £19,176 for the biosimilar and originator, respectively. Two-way sensitivity analyses suggested that if 50% of patients developed antibodies, the value-based price of £410 per vial must be lower than that of the originator (£420), but remain higher than the actual market price (£378). Conclusions The model supports the use of Inflecta ® for Crohn’s disease in the UK, and provides a framework for the quantitative evaluation of biosimilars in the context of a health technology assessment. Value-based pricing using this methodology could protect health systems from the potential risks of biosimilars where they are untested in the approved populations."

An age-stratified agent-based model was developed to explore the impact of shutdowns to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada under the assumption that current efforts to control the epidemic remains insufficient and in the absence of a vaccine. Methods: We estimated the current levels of interventions in Canada to generate a baseline scenario from 7 February to 7 September 2020. Four aspects of shutdowns were explored in scenarios that ran from 8 September 2020 to 7 January 2022, these included the impact of how quickly shutdowns are implemented, the duration of shutdowns, the minimum break (delays) between shutdowns and the types of sectors to shutdown. Comparisons among scenarios were made using cases, hospitalizations, deaths and shutdown days during the 700-day model runs. Results: We found a negative relationship between reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of shutdown days. However, we also found that for shutdowns to be optimally effective, they need to be implemented fast with minimal delay, initiated when community transmission is low, sustained for an adequate period and be stringent and target multiple sectors, particularly those driving transmission. By applying shutdowns in this manner, the total number of shutdown days could be reduced compared to delaying the shutdowns until further into the epidemic when transmission is higher and/or implementing short insufficient shutdowns that would require frequent re-implementation. This paper contrasts a range of shutdown strategies and trade-offs between health outcomes and economic metrics that need to be considered within the local context. Interpretation: Given the immense socioeconomic impact of shutdowns, they should be avoided where possible and used only when other public health measures are insufficient to control the epidemic. If used, the time it buys to delay the epidemic should be used to enhance other equally effective, but less disruptive, public health measures."
BoneChristopher2009Icsa,,"Integrating complexity science and artificial intelligence: GIS, agents and reinforcement learning for modeling forest cover change","Bone, Christopher",2009,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Forest cover change is a complex spatially dynamic phenomenon involving the interaction of numerous processes leading to emerging forest patterns over time. This is especially true when considering forestry operations that attempt to harvest trees for maximizing short-term profits while contending with natural disturbances, fluctuating economies, and the need to conserve long-term ecosystem functions. Conventional computer models assist harvesting activities by generating forest cover strategies that satisfy both economic and ecological objectives. However, such models ignore the dynamic forces that govern the harvesting process, and as such produce strategies that can be in direct conflict with emerging patterns. The purpose of this dissertation is to enhance existing modeling approaches by bridging complex systems theory and artificial intelligence in order to incorporate spatial and temporal complexities of forest harvesting. Specifically, this dissertation introduces a novel approach for integrating geographic information systems (GIS), agent-based modeling (ABM) and reinforcement learning (RL) for developing intelligent agents that can represent stakeholder behaviours and their influence on forest cover change. Agents embedded with RL algorithms possess learning mechanisms that allow them to gain knowledge from their experiences in a dynamic forest environment as represented by GIS digital data structures. Agents learn where and when harvesting activities should take place in the forest in order to satisfy different and at times conflicting objectives that exist at varying spatial scales. These objectives are achieved amidst fluctuating timber prices, the presence of natural disturbances, and the actions of other agents. Model results provide forest management with suitable harvesting strategies that satisfy conflicting objectives, information regarding the relationship between stakeholder interactions and emerging forest cover patterns, and the ability to evaluate the tradeoffs between different harvesting objectives. The developed approach is implemented in the context of forest management in British Columbia using datasets representing forest cover in the Chilliwack Forest District. This dissertation provides novel contributions to the fields of Geographical Information Science and Land Use/Cover Change by enhancing contemporary ABM approaches for simulating complex systems, and to the discipline of Forest Management by improving methods for understanding how to develop suitable forest cover patterns. Keywords: Geographic information systems; complex systems theory; artificial intelligence; agent-based modeling; reinforcement learning; forest cover change."

Designed and calibrated to the initial conditions of a small forest village in rural Bolivia, the model consists of: (a) an optimising agricultural household module of heterogeneous agents that make individually optimal land-use decisions based on factor endowments and market conditions; (b) an encompassing general equilibrium ‘shell’ module that endogenously determines wages and links the agricultural labour market and rural-urban migration rates; and (c) a novel user-controlled policy-maker module that allows the user to make ‘real time’ choices over a variety of public and environmental policies that in turn impact land use, welfare, and migration. Over a 20-year simulation period the results highlight trade-offs between reductions in deforestation and improvements in household welfare that can only be overcome either when international REDD payments are offered or when decentralized deforestation taxes are implemented. The sequencing of policies plays a critical role in the determination of these results."

This is true within domestic markets, but especially so for increasingly global corporations, as shareholder pressure for continued growth drives businesses into ever more widespread geographical markets. Arguing that more complex markets demand more sophisticated spatial analysis, this book discusses the application of location planning techniques to generate competitive advantage in a variety of business sectors in a changing retail environment. The series of techniques are analysed, from relatively straightforward branch scorecards to sophisticated applications of geographical information systems (GIS), spatial modelling and mathematical optimisation. Also explored are the changing dynamics of the impact of more restrictive planning environments in many countries on how retailers find new locations for growth and respond to changing consumer needs and wants. The book is essential reading for students and scholars alike working in geography, economics, business management, planning, finance and industry studies."

By incorporating an endogenous informed trading into an optimal incentive contracting model, we analytically show that, apart from reducing incentives, a greater risk increases the level of information-based trading, which consequently enhances executive incentives and offsets the negative risk-incentive relation. We calibrate the model and find that the economic magnitude of this incentive-enhancement effect is significant. Our empirical test using real-world executive compensation data lends strong support to the model prediction. Our results suggest that principals (boards of directors) should consider underlying stock trading characteristics when structuring executive incentives."

Our finding remains qualitatively robust to changes in parameter values and to modifications to our model that partly address the Lucas critique. Finally, we contribute a novel explanation for why cross-country regressions may fail to detect a significant negative effect of trend inflation on output even when such an effect exists in reality."

This study strikes a compromise between abstract and highly specified ABMs by designing a spatially explicit, stylized ABM and using it to explore policy scenarios in a setting that is facing substantial conservation and development challenges. Specifically, we present an ABM that reflects key Land Use/Land Cover dynamics and livelihood decisions on Isabela Island in the Galapagos Archipelago of Ecuador. We implement the model using the NetLogo software platform, a free program that requires relatively little programming experience. The landscape is composed of a satellite-derived distribution of a problematic invasive species (common guava) and a stylized representation of the Galapagos National Park, the community of Puerto Villamil, the agricultural zone, and the marine area. The agent module is based on publicly available data and household interviews and represents the primary livelihoods of the population in the Galapagos Islands—tourism, fisheries, and agriculture. We use the model to enact hypothetical agricultural subsidy scenarios aimed at controlling invasive guava and assess the resulting population and land cover dynamics. Findings suggest that spatially explicit, stylized ABMs have considerable utility, particularly during preliminary stages of research, as platforms for (1) sharpening conceptualizations of population-environment systems, (2) testing alternative scenarios, and (3) uncovering critical data gaps."

Biodiversity conservation differs in many respects to the classical applications of tradable permits like emissions control. One particularity is that, even if the permit system maintains a constant total amount of species habitat, habitat turnover (the destruction of a habitat and restoration elsewhere) affects the ecosystem. Another particularity is that the restoration of habitats often takes much time, leading to time lags between the initiation of restoration activities and the time when restored habitat is available for trading. We use an agent-based model of a tradable permit market to study the influence of heterogeneous and dynamic conservation costs and habitat restoration time lags on key variables of the market, such as the costs incurred to the market participants and the amount of habitat turnover. Our results show that there may be trade-offs between these key variables. We also find that restoration time lags can lead to fluctuations in permit prices that reduce the efficiency of the permit market. We conclude that temporal lags deserve a careful analysis when implementing tradable permit systems for the preservation of natural habitats and biodiversity. ►Consideration of restoration time lags in tradable permit schemes. ►Time lags may lead to market fluctuations that raise the cost of the scheme. ►Trade-offs may exist between cost of the scheme and habitat turnover. ►Habitat turnover may be controlled by taxing the restoration of habitat."
BrughmansTom2022SRET,,"Simulating Roman Economies: Theories, Methods, and Computational Models","Brughmans, Tom and Wilson, Andrew",2022,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,Oxford,"The use of formal modelling and computational simulation in studies of the Roman economy has become more common over the last decade. But detailed critical evaluations of this innovative approach are still missing and much needed. What kinds of insights about the Roman economy can it lead to that could not have been obtained through more established approaches, and how do simulation methods constructively enhance research processes in Roman Studies? This edited volume addresses this need through critical discussion and convincing examples. It presents the Roman economy as a highly complex system, traditionally studied through critical examinations of material and textual sources, and understood through a wealth of diverging theories. A key contribution of simulation lies in its ability to formally represent diverse theories of Roman economic phenomena and test them against empirical evidence. Critical simulation studies rely on collaboration across specialisms in Roman data, theory, and method, and can constructively enhance multivocality of theoretical debates of the Roman economy. This potential is illustrated, avoiding computational and mathematical language, through simulation studies of a wealth of Roman economic phenomena: from maritime trade and terrestrial transport infrastructures, through the economic impacts of the Antonine Plague and demography, to local cult economies and grain trade. Through these examples and discussions, this volume aims to provide the common ground, guidance, and inspiration needed to make simulation methods part of the tools of the trade in Roman Studies, and to allow them to make constructive contributions to our understanding of the Roman economy."

Empirical studies have evidenced extensively the existence of co-movement of asset prices or cross-correlation in market returns among these markets, especially in global event. However, there is no theoretical model in literature that can provide economically plausible justifications for these stylized facts. This research intends to fill up such a gap with a simplest possible nonlinear dynamic model. Based on the classical market-maker framework of Day and Huang (1990), a two-market HAM model is developed, which does not only prove in theory the existence of price co-movement but also replicate in simulation this typical characteristic, along with other well known stylized facts characterizing individual financial market. Moreover, theoretical analysis suggests meaningful implications for market opening policy. In particular, in terms of financial stability, a relatively small market may not benefit from market linkage and market opening is essentially a double-edged sword."

Cities offer spatial economic advantages that boost agglomeration forces and innovation, fostering further concentration of economic activities. For historic reasons urban centers cluster along coasts, which are prone to climate-induced flooding and sea level rise. To explore trade-offs between agglomeration economies and hazards increasing with climate change, we develop an evolutionary agent-based model with heterogeneous boundedly-rational agents who learn and adapt to a changing environment. The model combines migration decision of both households and firms between safe Inland and hazard-prone Coastal regions with endogenous technological learning and economic growth. Flood damages affect Coastal firms hitting their labour productivity, capital stock and inventories. We find that the model is able to replicate a rich set of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning economic and spatial dynamics. Without climate-induced shocks, the model shows how lower transport costs favour the Coastal region fueling the self-reinforcing and path-dependent agglomeration processes. We then introduce five scenarios of floods characterized by different frequency and severity to study the complex interplay of hazards with agglomeration patterns affecting the performance of the overall economy. We find that when shocks are mild or infrequent, they negatively affect the economic performance of the economy. If strong flood hazards hit frequently the Coastal region before agglomeration forces trigger high levels of the waterfront urbanization, firms and households can timely adapt and migrate landwards, thus averting the adverse impacts of climate shocks on the whole economy. Conversely, in the presence of climate tipping points where the frequency and magnitude of flood hazards abruptly intensifies, we find that economic activities remain trapped in the hazardprone region, generating lock-ins and leading to a harsh downturn of the overall economy."

As effectiveness data from randomized controlled trials were unavailable, relapse rates were modeled using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evidence. These described blood plasma levels of aripiprazole as a function of AM and AL dose regimens and described the probability of relapse as a function of aripiprazole blood plasma levels. The analysis had a time horizon of 1 year and took the US healthcare payer perspective. The incremental cost per relapse avoided and the probability of cost effectiveness were calculated in deterministic and probabilistic analyses. Scenario analyses explored the model’s main assumptions, and results were validated against external data and other cost-effectiveness analyses. Results Monthly administration of AM 400 mg consistently yielded the lowest predicted number of relapses across deterministic, probabilistic, and scenario analyses. The costs of treatment and relapses were projected to be the lowest with a monthly administration of AL 441 mg. The incremental cost per relapse avoided with AM 400 mg ranged from AM 400 mg being dominant to $US83,300. From willingness-to-pay thresholds of $US30,000 per relapse avoided, the probability of cost effectiveness was highest for AM 400 mg. The validation showed alignment with external data. Conclusion The analysis highlighted the robustness of the novel framework based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evidence and demonstrated an application in a postmarketing setting."
KadonoYasuo2015MoSE,,Management of Software Engineering Innovation in Japan,"Kadono, Yasuo",2015,,,,,,,Springer Japan,Tokyo,"This book assesses the achievements of the software engineering discipline as represented by IT vendors in Japan in order to deepen understanding of the mechanisms of how software engineering capabilities relate to IT vendors' business performance and business environment from the perspective of innovation and engineering management. Based on the concepts of service science and science for society, the volume suggests how to improve the sophistication of services between the demand side, i.e., IT user companies, and the supply side, i.e., IT vendors, simultaneously.The author and his colleagues developed a structural model including innovational paths, such as service innovation, product innovation and process innovation, and a measurement model including the seven software engineering capabilities: deliverables, project management, quality assurance, process improvement, research and development, human resource development and customer contact. Then they designed research on software engineering excellence and administered it with the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Information-Technology Promotion Agency. Through statistical analyses of the results, they found that human resource development and R&D are significant fundamental conditions to improve the quality of the deliverables and that IT firms with high levels of deliverables, derived from high levels of human resource development, quality assurance, project management and process improvement, tend to sustain high profitability. In addition, they developed a measurement model based on Porter's five forces and Barney's resource-based view. A regression tree analysis suggested that manufacturer spin-off vendors tend to expand business with well-resourced R&D, whereas user spin-off vendors tend to depend heavily on parent company demand."

Our objective is to discuss the modelling gaps and opportunities to advance the science for multisector adaptation and tradeoffs. We focus on power system operational models, which typically represent key physical and economic aspects of grid operations over days to a year and assume a fixed power grid infrastructure. Due to computational burden, models are typically customized to reflect regional resource opportunities, data availability, and applications of interest. We conceptualize power system operational models with four core processes: physical grid assets (generation, transmission, loads, and storage), model objectives and purpose, institutions and decision agents, and performance metrics. We taxonomize the representations of these core processes based on a review of 23 existing models. Using science questions around grid and short term uncertainties, long term global change, and multisectoral technological innovation as examples, we report on tradeoffs in process fidelity and tractability that have been adopted by the research community to represent multisectoral interactions in power system operational models. Our recommendations for research directions are model-agnostic, focusing on core processes, their interactions with other human systems, and consider computational tradeoffs. •23 power system operational models are reviewed to develop a process-based taxonomy.•The taxonomy of core process representations is model agnostic.•We discuss key core process representation and computational tradeoffs by science question.•We identify technical gaps and opportunities to support multisector dynamics research."

To date, no formal guidance has been developed regarding how such adjustments should be made. We compared various covariate-adjusted survival modeling approaches, as applied to the ENDEAVOR trial in multiple myeloma that assessed carfilzomib plus dexamethasone (Cd) versus bortezomib plus dexamethasone (Vd). Methods Overall survival (OS) data and baseline characteristics were used for a subgroup (bortezomib-naïve/one prior therapy). Four adjusted survival modeling approaches were compared: propensity score weighting followed by fitting a Weibull model to the two arms of the balanced data (weighted data approach); fitting a multiple Weibull regression model including prognostic/predictive covariates to the two arms to predict survival using the mean value of each covariate and using the average of patient-specific survival predictions; and applying an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) derived from a Cox proportional hazard model to the baseline risk estimated for Vd. Results The mean OS estimated by the weighted data approach was 6.85 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.62–10.70) for Cd, 4.68 years (95% CI 3.46–6.74) for Vd, and 2.17 years (95% CI 0.18–5.06) for the difference. Although other approaches estimated similar differences, using the mean value of covariates appeared to yield skewed survival estimates (mean OS was 7.65 years for Cd and 5.40 years for Vd), using the average of individual predictions had limited external validity (implausible long-term OS predictions with > 10% of the Vd population alive after 30 years), and using the adjusted HR approach overestimated uncertainty (difference in mean OS was 2.03, 95% CI − 0.17 to 6.19). Conclusions Adjusted survival modeling based on weighted or matched data approaches provides a flexible and robust method to correct for covariate imbalances in economic evaluations. The conclusions of our study may be generalizable to other settings. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01568866 (ENDEAVOR trial)."

This paper deals with how groups of agents emerge in a dynamic contest characterized by lack of formal structure and uncertainty regarding the possible individual outcomes, focusing on the features of the cooperators and on the dynamics emerging among them. Through the development of a stylized agent-based model we start by showing how similarity in values can be a successful driver for cooperation but are also able to highlight the limits of such process, by looking at how and how much agents cooperate with similar others. A second-version of the model, where memory of past interactions has a role, introduces further dynamics and is able to create successful and relatively stable groups."
ByromElizabethGayle2023TUoa,,The Use of an Agent-Based Model for the HAZMAT Routing Game,"Byrom, Elizabeth Gayle",2023,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This doctoral research focuses on a new idea about how to analyze the routing of hazardous materials (HAZMAT). Finding efficient routing solutions is of upmost importance for several reasons. First, the movements related to these routing patterns create societal costs related to the risks of population exposure and impacts to the environment. Second, this transport creates an economic cost for both the carriers and society.This research explores the idea of using a game-based paradigm to find a balance between HAZMAT shipments related to risks and costs. Historically, this domain has been explored by using analytical, system-focused problem formulations that look at the tradeoffs among risk, cost, and other objectives. However, these approaches have given little attention to the differences in preferences that exist among the stakeholders. They assume that all entities involved have complete access to the information pertinent to the routing decisions. We perceive that this is likely not reflective of the real-world environment. Our aim is to address these limitations by illustrating how the perspectives of the carrier and the network operating authority are distinct, the choices they make are not the same, and the information they have for making decisions is different.This relationship is explored in a game-like setting where there is an authority and a carrier. The authority aims to minimize risk by controlling the routing of the hazardous material shipments crossing the network. To do this, it implements tolls that encourage the carrier to select low-risk routes. In response, the carrier seeks to minimize cost, including the tolls it encounters, as it evaluates its k-shortest or k-least-cost paths. As a result of these interactions, the two stakeholders arrive at a transport solution that each perceives as acceptable.We use an agent-based modeling framework to implement our idea. We have the carrier and the authority interact iteratively, arriving at a seemingly acceptable transport solution for each player. Further, we illustrate how limited observability through varying levels of cooperation between the players has an impact on the solutions that emerge to further advance the frontier in this domain. For example, the authority can only see the flows on arcs that have been instrumented in some manner or if the carrier cooperates by providing the authority with its routing plans. Similarly, the carrier can only see tolls on the arcs it chooses to use or if the authority provides the carrier with the tolling locations and prices. Our agent-based formulation advances previous efforts by allowing us to see how this limited observability, completed through varying levels of cooperation, affects the players’ understanding of the environment in which they are interacting.From an analyst’s perspective, our agent-based model forces us to consider what is and is not observable across the network through various levels of cooperation and the implications of those limitations. The results suggest that different levels of observability do result in different game solutions. Our findings also show that it is possible to find routing solutions using both a traditional analytical model and our game-like formulation that minimize the risk to the population and the economic cost of transportation for hazardous materials."
KnudsenThorbjørn2014CEOJ,,Coordinated Exploration: Organizing Joint Search by Multiple Specialists to Overcome Mutual Confusion and Joint Myopia,"Knudsen, Thorbjørn and Srikanth, Kannan",2014,Administrative science quarterly,59,3,409-441,,,Sage Publications,"Los Angeles, CA","In this paper, we use an agent-based simulation model to investigate how coordinated exploration by multiple specialists, as in new product development, is different from individual search. We find that coordinated exploration is subject to two pathologies not present in unitary search: mutual confusion and joint myopia. In joint search, feedback to one agent's actions is confounded by the actions of the other agent. Search therefore leads to increasing mutual confusion because agents are unable to learn from feedback to correct their faulty mental models of the search space. Incorrect beliefs held by one agent lead to mistakes, and because it is unclear which agent was wrong, this confuses the other agent, either into revising (correct) beliefs or holding on to (incorrect) beliefs. Sharing knowledge aligns specialists' mental models and counters mutual confusion by inducing coordination around particular search regions. Yet that very effort increases joint myopia, as agents prematurely reinforce each other into choosing from an increasingly narrow portion of the search space. In the extreme, high levels of shared knowledge induce agents to abandon their distinct search approach in favor of a lower common denominator. In coordinated exploration, increasing coordination efforts (such as by increasing communication) reduces mutual confusion but simultaneously increases joint myopia. Efforts to reduce joint myopia, such as by slow learning or lower levels of knowledge transfer, however, automatically increase mutual confusion. As modeled in our simulation, successful joint search needs to balance these two effects. Our results suggest that because unitary-searcher models abstract from epistemic interdependence, their predictions are potentially misleading for coordinated exploration."

We focus in particular on evolutionary algorithms that use a binary encoding of strategies. These algorithms, commonly referred to as genetic algorithms, are popular in agent-based computational economics research. In many studies, however, there is no clear reason for the use of a binary encoding of strategies. We therefore examine to what extent the use of such an encoding may influence the results produced by an evolutionary algorithm. It turns out that the use of a binary encoding can have quite significant effects. Since these effects do not have a meaningful economic interpretation, they should be regarded as artifacts. Our findings indicate that in general the use of a binary encoding is undesirable. They also highlight the importance of employing evolutionary algorithms with a sensible economic interpretation."

P. and Minyi Huang",2012,IEEE transactions on automatic control,57,11,2801-2816,,,IEEE,PISCATAWAY,"We study large population leader-follower stochastic multi-agent systems where the agents have linear stochastic dynamics and are coupled via their quadratic cost functions. The cost of each leader is based on a trade-off between moving toward a certain reference trajectory which is unknown to the followers and staying near their own centroid. On the other hand, followers react by tracking a convex combination of their own centroid and the centroid of the leaders. We approach this large population dynamic game problem by use of so-called Mean Field (MF) linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) stochastic control theory. In this model, followers are adaptive in the sense that they use a likelihood ratio estimator (on a sample population of the leaders' trajectories) to identify the member of a given finite class of models which is generating the reference trajectory of the leaders. Under appropriate conditions, it is shown that the true reference trajectory model is identified by each follower in finite time with probability one as the leaders' population goes to infinity. Furthermore, we show that the resulting sets of mean field control laws for both leaders and adaptive followers possess an almost sure ε N -Nash equilibrium property for a system with population N where ε N goes to zero as N goes to infinity. Numerical experiments are presented illustrating the results."

It is the latter that are at the root of this and other crises. We argue that the RA approach is simply not up to the task of enhancing our understanding of modern macroeconomies and that the standard cannot provide an adequate framework for understanding the economy even in more normal times. We advocate a bottom-up approach, where high-level (macroeconomic) systems may possess new and different properties than the low-level (microeconomic) systems on which they are based. The heterogeneous agent approach provides an alternative, one which has already proven its metal in helping us understand the interlinkages which helped give rise to the crisis."

In both chapters recent modeling tools in the international trade literature are applied to the study of spatial inequality in cities and its sources in chapter 1 or scaling up agricultural policy interventions in chapter 2. These tools are used to answer research questions in the context of quantitative general equilibrium models that feature rich heterogeneity but remain tractable. Moreover, the models in this dissertation predict clear relationships between the choices of households, firms and aggregate variables that are disciplined with detailed microdata. The first chapter Two-Sided Sorting and Spatial Inequality in Cities studies a new economic force underlying the spatial sorting of rich and poor households in cities. On the demand side, households with different incomes choose neighborhoods and differ in their expenditures across various local services. On the supply side, service establishments sort into neighborhoods while taking into account proximity to their consumers. This two-sided sorting leads to endogenous differences in the local price index that amplify the concentration of household groups. A recent literature in urban economics has rationalized spatial sorting of households that is left unexplained by local incomes or housing costs by modeling pure amenity spillovers. In this chapter, I quantify the contribution of endogenous price indices to spatial sorting that is usually projected onto such reduced-form spillovers, and study the implications of two-sided sorting for urban policy. To do so, I develop a quantitative equilibrium model of the city that features two-sided sorting and nests many urban models. I estimate the key parameters of the model using detailed microdata for Los Angeles from 1990-2014. I find that spatial variation in local price indices decreases the estimates of reduced-form spillovers by about 30-50 percent. To shed light on the policy implications, I simulate policy counterfactuals, and compare the effects to the existing framework with only reduced-form amenity spillovers. By studying a number of prominent place-based policies in Los Angeles, I find substantially different effects on neighborhood composition and welfare between both models.The second chapter Scaling Agricultural Policy Interventions: Theory and Evidence from Uganda studies the welfare and distributional effects of scaling agricultural interventions in general equilibrium. Interventions aimed at raising agricultural productivity in developing countries have been a centerpiece in the global fight against poverty. These policies are increasingly informed by evidence from field experiments and natural experiments, with the well-known limitation that findings based on local variation generally do not speak to the general equilibrium (GE) effects if the intervention were to be scaled up to the national level. In this chapter, we develop a new framework to quantify these forces based on a combination of theory and rich but widely available microdata. We build a quantitative GE model of farm production and trade, and propose a new solution method in this environment for studying high-dimensional counterfactuals at the level of individual households in the macroeconomy. We then bring to bear microdata from Uganda to calibrate the model to all households populating the country. We use these building blocks to explore the average and distributional implications of local shocks compared to policies at scale, and quantify the underlying mechanisms."

In this article, we investigate the impact of repeated OOS occurrences under different supply chain design scenarios, which mix the channel replenishment strategy with the inventory responsibility for in-store shelf management on the retailer versus on the manufacturer. We frame our agent-based simulation to examine the change in manufacturer's market share that results from OOS scenarios not only under different supply chain distribution scenarios (i.e., traditional versus direct store delivery or DSD), but also with different consumer preference characteristics (i.e., high and low brand loyalty) and varied levels of demand. The agent-based simulation allows us to examine the impact of consumer learning under repeated OOS situations. Our results provide new insights for manufacturers regarding repeated supply chain OOS situations."

We use the model as a simulation platform by which we perform several experiments of monetary policy. Simulations showed a clear nonneutrality of monetary policy, which finds its transmission mechanism in the credit channel. Besides, we also evaluated the performance of a monetary Authority whose reaction function was modelled according to a standard Taylor rule, which turns out to be quite successful as an effective macro-stabilization tool."

The goal of this work is to investigate tradeoffs between water services and economic considerations in the southeastern United States.First, using statistical modeling, a historical relationship between major landscape indicators and water quality in north central Florida is investigated. Having established local land cover-water quality dynamics, land cover change as a result of requiring landowner agents to conform to hypothetical numeric nutrient criteria over several years is examined for the Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW) in south Georgia. Economic considerations are explored further in the context of water yields. A growth and yield model was employed to estimate physical changes in water yield and assign monetary values to these changes under different regimes of forest thinning and planting density for a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand located in southeast Georgia. Private landowners growing loblolly pine throughout Georgia were subsequently surveyed in a bid to determine willingness to accept (WTA) amounts associated with relative changes in increased thinnings and decreased planting densities.Results from our initial land cover regression model show a large proportion of agricultural cover was consistently associated with larger increases in groundwater pollutant loads relative to urban or forest cover across all models. The watershed modeling that followed generally pointed to a large increase in forest cover, particularly in those parcels nearest the watershed outlet as a result of complying with progressively stricter water quality standards over time. Derived values of corresponding annual water yield and NPV estimates based on the simulated G&Y model found that additional units of water become less costly to ’produce’ as the changes to thinnings and planting densities intensify. The state-wide mail survey of private Georgia forest landowners suggested landowners had higher preference for undertaking proposed management practices, the higher the bid amount, all else equal. Overall findings from this work suggests a need for widespread adoption of cost-effective practices in managing both agricultural lands and forest lands to help better attain regional water security."

They can be described at a great variety of scales, from individuals and organisations to countries. Our understanding, often partial, of these entities, and in many cases this understanding is represented in theories and associated mathematical models. In this book, the main examples are models that represent elements of the global system covering such topics as trade, migration, security and development aid together with examples at finer scales. This provides an effective toolkit that can not only be applied to global systems, but more widely in the modelling of complex systems. All complex systems involve nonlinearities involving path dependence and the possibility of phase changes and this makes the mathematical aspects particularly interesting. It is through these mechanisms that new structures can be seen to 'emerge', and hence the current notion of 'emergent behaviour'. The range of models demonstrated include account-based models and biproportional fitting, structural dynamics, space-time statistical analysis, real-time response models, Lotka-Volterra models representing 'war', agent-based models, epidemiology and reaction-diffusion approaches, game theory, network models and finally, integrated models.

Such enterprises depend on a supply of endangered species for their revenue. Many of these enterprises, however, cannot purchase a supply of this resource and are largely unable to secure the resource against theft in the form of poaching. Because replacements are not available once a species becomes extinct, insurance products are not available to reduce the risk exposure of these enterprises to an extinction event. For many species, the dynamics of anthropogenic impacts driven by economic as well as noneconomic values of associated wildlife products along with their ecological stressors can help meaningfully predict extinction risks. We develop an agent/individual-based economic-ecological model that captures these effects and apply it to the case of South African rhinos. Our model uses observed rhino dynamics and poaching statistics. It seeks to predict rhino extinction under the present scenario. This scenario has no legal horn trade, but allows live African rhino trade and legal hunting. Present rhino populations are small and threatened by a rising onslaught of poaching. This present scenario and associated dynamics predicts continued decline in rhino population size with accelerated extinction risks of rhinos by 2036. Our model supports the computation of extinction risks at any future time point. This capability can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed conservation strategies at reducing a species' extinction risk. Models used to compute risk predictions, however, need to be statistically estimated. We point out that statistically fitting such models to observations will involve massive numbers of observations on consumer behavior and time-stamped location observations on thousands of animals. Finally, we propose Big Data algorithms to perform such estimates and to interpret the fitted model's output."

To identify the behavioral mechanisms and effects of tobacco control policies designed to reduce tobacco retailer density. Methods. We developed the Tobacco Town agent-based simulation model to examine 4 types of retailer reduction policies: (1) random retailer reduction, (2) restriction by type of retailer, (3) limiting proximity of retailers to schools, and (4) limiting proximity of retailers to each other. The model examined the effects of these policies alone and in combination across 4 different types of towns, defined by 2 levels of population density (urban vs suburban) and 2 levels of income (higher vs lower). Results. Model results indicated that reduction of retailer density has the potential to decrease accessibility of tobacco products by driving up search and purchase costs. Policy effects varied by town type: proximity policies worked better in dense, urban towns whereas retailer type and random retailer reduction worked better in less-dense, suburban settings. Conclusions. Comprehensive retailer density reduction policies have excellent potential to reduce the public health burden of tobacco use in communities."

Also, implementation of an ACO is costly in terms of time and money. Immature design could cause safety hazards. Therefore, there is a need for analytical model-based decision-support tools that can predict the outcomes of different strategies to facilitate ACO design and implementation. In this study, an agent-based simulation model was developed to study ACOs that considers payers, healthcare providers, and patients as agents under the shared saving payment model of care for congestive heart failure (CHF), one of the most expensive causes of sometimes preventable hospitalizations. The agent-based simulation model has identified the critical determinants for the payment model design that can motivate provider behavior changes to achieve maximum financial and quality outcomes of an ACO. The results show nonlinear provider behavior change patterns corresponding to changes in payment model designs. The outcomes vary by providers with different quality or financial priorities, and are most sensitive to the cost-effectiveness of CHF interventions that an ACO implements. This study demonstrates an increasingly important method to construct a healthcare system analytics model that can help inform health policy and healthcare management decisions. The study also points out that the likely success of an ACO is interdependent with payment model design, provider characteristics, and cost and effectiveness of healthcare interventions."

It is important for traders holding positions in CT and MOM strategies to be aware of their asymmetric time-varying shifting trends. Such knowledge helps traders diversify their positions and manage their portfolios more appropriately. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the diversification role of currency momentum for carry trade crashes during the turbulent periods surrounding the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis and the 2007–2008 global financial crisis. The motivation is to use an important tendency of momentum strategy to yield statistically and economically significant profits during crisis periods that are far higher than the crashes commonly experienced with the carry trade. I use an empirical heterogeneous agent model to design a new trading strategy which combines carry trade and momentum signals where the relative weight given to both signals is based on their past performance. The main finding is that the combined strategy is a good hedge with desirable diversification merits in times of financial stress. This evidence has important implications for the practices of currency portfolio management during times of heightened financial uncertainty."

As shown by Gabaix (Econometrica 79:733–772, 2011 ), the skewed nature of firm size distributions implies that idiosyncratic (and independent) firm-level shocks may account for a significant portion of aggregate volatility. Yet, we question the original view grounded on “supply granularity”, as proxied by productivity growth shocks – in line with the Real Business Cycle framework–, and we provide empirical evidence of a “demand granularity”, based on investment growth shocks instead. The role of demand in explaining aggregate fluctuations is further corroborated by means of a macroeconomic Agent-Based Model of the “Schumpeter meeting Keynes” family Dosi et al. (J Econ Dyn Control 52:166–189, 2015 ). Indeed, the investigation of the possible microfoundation of RBC has led us to the identification of a sort of microfounded Keynesian multiplier."

We used a coupled human and natural systems framework and an agent-based landscape model to examine how alternative management scenarios affect fire and ecosystem services metrics in a fire-prone multiownership landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon. Our model incorporated existing models of vegetation succession and fire spread and information from original empirical studies of landowner decision making. Our findings indicate that alternative management strategies can have variable effects on landscape outcomes over 50 years for fire, socioeconomic, and ecosystem services metrics. For example, scenarios with federal restoration treatments had slightly less high-severity fire than a scenario without treatment; exposure of homes in the wildland-urban interface to fire was also slightly less with restoration treatments compared to no management. Treatments appeared to be more effective at reducing high-severity fire in years with more fire than in years with less fire. Under the current management scenario, timber production could be maintained for at least 50 years on federal lands. Under an accelerated restoration scenario, timber production fell because of a shortage of areas meeting current stand structure treatment targets. Trade-offs between restoration outcomes (e.g., open forests with large fire-resistant trees) and habitat for species that require dense older forests were evident. For example, the proportional area of nesting habitat for northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) was somewhat less after 50 years under the restoration scenarios than under no management. However, the amount of resilient older forest structure and habitat for white-headed woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus) was higher after 50 years under active management. More carbon was stored on this landscape without management than with management, despite the occurrence of high-severity wildfire. Our results and further applications of the model could be used in collaborative settings to facilitate discussion and development of policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes."

Proceedings,,,6-Jan,,,Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE),Norcross,"Decision-making plays an important role in the field of supply chain management, especially when it deals with evaluating and selecting suppliers (SS). SS is concerned with finding appropriate suppliers based on the criterion defined by a buyer. Suppliers need to be selected wisely to prevent known and unknown consequences that companies may face when a wrong supplier is selected. As such, companies desire to work with preferred suppliers, and develop sustainable relations with these suppliers. With these sustainable relations, they may guarantee high-quality products and services to their customers. Sustainable supplier selection includes aspects such as economic, social, and environmental. In this research, we used agent-based modeling (ABM) as a tool to model a situation where there is a fixed list of suppliers, and the goal is to buy products from a list of suppliers with high sustainability performance; as such, evaluate suppliers based on their sustainability performance while helping them improve their performance. The main incentive behind this research is to find the possible durations that it would take to satisfy the required buyer's demand and achieve high sustainability performance by all suppliers. The output of ABM is being used as an input to a machine learning technique to give insight to decision-makers about durations to find potential suppliers to satisfy the demand. The output of the machine learning technique showed that when the average of suppliers' sustainability performance is greater than a certain level, there is a high probability of satisfying the demand by some predetermined expected duration."

It extends the evolution of an n-person prisoner’s dilemma within actual geographical space, integrating an agent-based model with GIS, in conflicting spatial interactions that ultimately lead to the decline of cooperation. The spatial agent-based model captures the response strategies of autonomous individuals in a landscape that contextualizes both the natural and the built environment. The result suggests that the loss of context preservation could lead to the extinction of cooperation, the opposite of the earlier findings. This theoretical framework thus serves as a basis for the analysis of collective strategic decisions about the use of a common resource from a game theoretical perspective."

We find that varying the dynamics of agent interaction causes the emergence of differential degree distributions as well as nonlinear dynamics in social and spatial inequalities. The scale-free property of degree connectivity vanishes when tie formation dominates tie dissolution, with power laws re-emerging when tie dissolution is of equal strength or stronger than tie formation. Furthermore, we find a nonlinear relationship between network density and agent inequality in social resources. In particular, multiple phase transitions occur where the relationship is positive in one phase but negative in another. This suggests that, contrary to intuition, higher connectivity can have an adverse distributional impact by benefiting the already privileged. Critically, we find a tradeoff between agent inequality and spatial inequality where the geographic concentration of social resources accompanies a more equal distribution of connectivity. Finally, the disadvantage of agents with limited spatial reach is exacerbated as network density increases. Our results thus highlight the importance of distinguishing between social and spatial inequality in policymaking."

As such, prison systems offer a unique opportunity to control the HCV epidemic. New HCV-treatment drugs are very effective, but providing treatment to all inmates is prohibitively expensive unless prices fall. Current practice is to prioritize treatment based on disease severity and puts less emphasis on other factors such as the remaining sentence length and injection drug use behavior. In “Prioritizing Hepatitis C Treatment in U.S. Prisons,” T. Ayer, C. Zhang, A. Bonifonte, A. Spaulding, and J. Chhatwal analyze optimal approaches for treatment prioritization under resource constraints by developing a restless bandit modeling framework. They present an easy-to-implement closed-form index policy to support hepatitis C treatment prioritization decisions in U.S. prisons. They also test their proposed policy using a detailed, realistic agent-based simulation model and shed light on several controversial health policy decisions related to hepatitis C treatment prioritization. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence in prison systems is 10 times higher than in the general population, and hence prison systems offer a unique opportunity to control the HCV epidemic. New HCV treatment drugs are very effective, but providing treatment to all inmates is prohibitively expensive, which precludes universal HCV treatment in prison systems. As such, current practice recommends prioritizing treatment based on clinical and incarceration-related factors, including disease staging, remaining sentence length, and injection drug use (IDU) status. However, there is controversy about how these factors should be incorporated because of the complicated trade-offs. In this study, we propose a restless bandit modeling framework to support hepatitis C treatment prioritization decisions in U.S. prisons. We first prove indexability for our problem and derive several structural properties of the well-known Whittle’s index, based on which we derive a closed-form expression of the Whittle’s index for patients with advanced liver disease. From the interpretation of this closed-form expression, we anticipate that the performance of the Whittle’s index would degrade as the treatment capacity increases, and to address this limitation, we propose a capacity-adjusted closed-form index policy. We parameterize and validate our model using real-world data and published studies and test the performance of our proposed policy against several benchmark policies using a realistic agent-based simulation model. Our results shed light on several controversial health policy issues in hepatitis C treatment prioritization: (1) prioritization based on only liver health status, a commonly practiced policy, is suboptimal compared with many other policies; further, considering remaining sentence length of inmates and IDU status in addition to liver health status in prioritization decisions can lead to a significant performance improvement; (2) while usually prioritizing patients with longer sentence lengths is the right choice, prioritizing patients with shorter remaining sentence lengths may be preferable if the treatment capacity inside the prison system is not very tight and the linkage-to-care level outside the prison system is low; and (3) among patients with advanced liver disease, IDUs should not be prioritized unless their reinfection is very well controlled.

In addition to their intrinsic complexity, spatial problems usually involve groups of actors from different organizational and cognitive backgrounds, all of whom participate in a social structure to resolve or reduce the complexity of a given problem. Hence, it is important to study and evaluate what different aspects influence the spatial problem resolution process. Recently, multi-agent systems consisting of groups of separate agent entities all interacting with each other have been put forward as appropriate tools to use to study and resolve such problems. In this study, then in order to generate a better level of understanding regarding the spatial problem group decision-making process, a conceptual multi-agent-based framework is used that represents and specifies all the necessary concepts and entities needed to aid group decision making, based on a simulation of the group decision-making process as well as the relationships that exist among the different concepts involved. The study uses five main influencing entities as concepts in the simulation process: spatial influence, individual-level influence, group-level influence, negotiation influence and group performance measures. Further, it explains the relationship among different concepts in a descriptive rather than explanatory manner. To illustrate the proposed framework, the approval process for an urban land use master plan in Zanjan—a provincial capital in Iran—is simulated using MAS, the results highlighting the effectiveness of applying an MAS-based framework when wishing to study the group decision-making process used to resolve spatial problems."

In this paper, we propose and test the idea of incorporating incentives to crowdsourcing management for rainfall monitoring. Specifically, we model the allocation of incentives (quantitatively measurable and limited rewards) among crowdsourcing participants for a theoretical rainfall monitoring case. For this purpose, we develop an integrated model comprising a reward allocation component to represent the decision-making process of a central manager, an agent-based model to simulate the interactions between the manager and participants, and a rainfall simulation model to evaluate the effectiveness of various reward allocation policies. We simulate six reward allocation policies of varying levels of administrative cost, and consideration of participant and rainfall spatial heterogeneities. The results suggest the performance of each policy to improve with the reward budget and their spatial uniformity. Among the six policies tested, we find that the participant density weighted maximum participation policy yields the most accurate estimation of rainfall intensity due to its more explicit consideration of the spatial distribution of participants; however, this policy associates with a high administrative cost. This highlights the trade-off between performance and cost in designing effective reward allocation policies. This paper provides a physical and behavior simulation modeling tool to study the feasibility and complexity of reward-based participant management for crowdsourcing rainfall monitoring. The proposed crowdsourcing method is beneficial for a wide range of applications that require rainfall data with fine resolution, such as storm water management and water availability and biomass assessment for food and energy crops.

Like other industries, the maritime business faces different and difficult problems which threaten organizational survival. The ability to cope with those uncertainties, threats and problems shows the resilience ability of organizations that help to survive and prosper. The organizational resilience concept arises as a requirement to deal with problems and uncertainties of business environments which are swiftly changing. This study aims to suggest an organizational framework to show how maritime business organizations as the sea leg of global transportation system can develop resilient organizations via complex adaptive systems (CAS) approach if adequate design features of CAS could be defined and included in organizational properties.Design/methodology/approachA total of 15 CAS features were identified as the enablers of organizational resilience throughout the literature. An interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach has been conducted to determine the mutual relation between the CAS features which constitute an organizational framework. These CAS features have been categorized by conducting MICMAC analysis.FindingsThis study proposes a framework that identifies CAS features as the enabler of resilient maritime business organizations. The CAS approach offers new managerial toolkit to realize current organizational situations and allows managers to understand that it is difficult to control their system in this dynamic environment where special management practices are required especially in volatile times rather than ordinary times. Also, organizations could not compete as a sole organization but as a web/system of organizations. CAS is more resilient than other systems because resilience is the emergent occurrence of the system formed from nonlinear, dynamic interactions with self-organized agents.Research limitations/implicationsThe research has some limitations, like organizational resilience studies are in the infant stage and further research into this area should be extended. This study uses the CAS approach to develop organizational resilience. Further studies could use different lenses and contemporary subjects in management field which should also be useful while developing resilience in organizations. This study uses ISM and MICMAC analysis where further studies could use quantitative design and methods like formal concept analysis or the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory to determine the relational weighs of CAS features while developing resilient organizations. Future studies may also focus on different maritime stakeholders like IMO or ILO, maritime agencies, freight forwarders or insurance underwriters regarding developing and enhancing resilience of the maritime system.Practical implicationsWorld trade and transportation systems are getting more uncertain and lean on complex relations where maritime transportation is a “vital backbone” of such operations. But becoming more complex structures leads to vulnerable systems and organizations. Most risk management applications are based on predicting the known risks where many of them are not enough to fight with unknowns. Coping with today's problems are difficult for organizations in any industry. But for maritime business stakeholders who work in such a global web of relations, it is much more challenging. So, stakeholders of the system like forwarders, ports or ship chandlers may easily apply those features to develop resilient organizations too. Legal authorities of the system and rule-makers like local Chambers of Shipping, IMO or Classification societies can benefit from this framework and provide supportive settings to develop system-wide resilient organizations.Social implicationsBy understanding environmental uncertainty and complexity better than others, organizations become resilient and cope with significant difficulties which make them more competitive as a substantial strategic advantage. Resilient management offers to break down points at the system and shows them ways to restore quickly while transporting goods while traditional risk assessments are not enough.Originality/valueThe originality of the study lies in two folds; first of all the key and most used features of CAS is linked to developing resilient maritime organizations and by maritime expert opinions, this study tries to determine which of these CAS features are the most effective to trigger other features to develop organizational resilience in the maritime business. And secondly, the concept of organizational resilience and the CAS approach are not analyzed in depth in the context of maritime business."

In their recent work, Waltman et al. (J Evol Econ 21(5): 737–756, 2011 ) consider binary encoding and its possible contribution to a phenomenon referred to as premature convergence; the observation that different individual runs of the genetic algorithm can lead to very different results. While Alkemade et al. (Comput Econ 28(4): 355–370, 2006 ), (Comput Intell 23(2): 162–175, 2007 ), (Comput Econ 33(1): 99–101, 2009 ) argue that premature convergence is caused by insufficient population size, Waltman et al. argue that this phenomenon depends crucially on strategies being encoded in binary form. This conclusion is based on their illustration that premature convergence can be avoided even in simulations with small populations so long as real, rather than binary, encoding of strategies is utilized. Utilizing their methodology, we return to the consideration of the cause of premature convergence. After robustness checks with respect to the length of the binary string used for encoding, the fitness function, and the form of mutation, it is concluded that an alternative specification of mutation may also alleviate the occurrence of premature convergence. It is argued that this alternative form of mutation may be more appropriate in a wider range of problems where real encoding of strategies may not prove sufficient."

Each agent does not know what the available options are and can choose an option only after observing another agent who has already chosen that option. In addition, the agents' preferences over the two options are correlated. An agent can either imitate an observed agent or wait until he meets two agents who made different choices, in which case he can compare their choices and choose accordingly. A novel feature of the model is that agents observe not only the choices made by others, but also some information about the process that led them to those choices. We study two cases: In the first, an agent notes whether the observed agent imitated others or whether he actually compared the available alternatives. In the second, an agent notes whether the observed agent's decision was hasty or not. It is shown that in equilibrium the probability of making a mistake is higher in the second case and that the existence of these nonstandard ""neuro"" observations systematically biases the equilibrium distribution of choices."
TheobaldThomas2015Arm–,,Agent-based risk management – a regulatory approach to financial markets,"Theobald, Thomas",2015,Journal of economic studies (Bradford),42,5,780-820,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide market risk calculation for an equity-based trading portfolio. Instead of relying on the purely stochastic internal model method which banks currently apply in line with the Basel regulatory requirements, the author also propose including alternative price mechanisms from the financial literature in the regulatory framework. Design/methodology/approach – For this purpose, a financial market model with heterogeneous agents is developed, capturing the realistic feature that parts of the investors do not follow the assumption of no arbitrage, but are motivated by behavioral heuristics instead. Findings – Although both the standard stochastic and the behavioral model are restricted to a calibration including the last 250 trading days, the latter is able to capitalize possible turbulence on financial markets and likewise the well-known phenomenon of excess volatility – even if the last 250 days reflect a non-turbulent market. Practical implications – Thus, including agent-based models in the regulatory framework could create better capital requirements with respect to their level and counter-cyclicality. Originality/value – This in turn could reduce the extent to which bubbles arise, since market participants would have to anticipate comprehensively the costs of such bubbles bursting. Furthermore, a key ratio is deduced from the agent-based construction to lower the influence of speculative derivatives."

I.",2022,PharmacoEconomics,40,8,823-833,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,"Objectives Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health threat associated with antibiotic consumption. Community-acquired acute respiratory tract infections (CA-ARTIs) are a major driver of antibiotic consumption in primary care. We aimed to quantify the investments required for a large-scale rollout of point-of care (POC) diagnostic testing in Dutch primary care, and the impact on AMR due to reduced use of antibiotics. Methods We developed an individual-based model that simulates consultations for CA-ARTI at GP practices in the Netherlands and compared a scenario where GPs test all CA-ARTI patients with a hypothetical diagnostic strategy to continuing the current standard-of-care for the years 2020–2030. We estimated differences in costs and future AMR rates caused by testing all patients consulting for CA-ARTI with a hypothetical diagnostic strategy, compared to the current standard-of-care in GP practices. Results Compared to the current standard-of-care, the diagnostic algorithm increases the total costs of GP consultations for CA-ARTI by 9% and 19%, when priced at €5 and €10, respectively. The forecast increase in Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance against penicillins can be partly restrained by the hypothetical diagnostic strategy from 3.8 to 3.5% in 2030, albeit with considerable uncertainty. Conclusions Our results show that implementing a hypothetical diagnostic strategy for all CA-ARTI patients in primary care raises the costs of consultations, while lowering antibiotic consumption and AMR. Novel health-economic methods to assess and communicate the potential benefits related to AMR may be required for interventions with limited gains for individual patients, but considerable potential related to antibiotic consumption and AMR."

However, there may be situations where constraints imposed by market institutions dominate strategic agent behavior. We use data from the London Stock Exchange to test a simple model in which minimally intelligent agents place orders to trade at random. The model treats the statistical mechanics of order placement, price formation, and the accumulation of revealed supply and demand within the context of the continuous double auction and yields simple laws relating order-arrival rates to statistical properties of the market. We test the validity of these laws in explaining cross-sectional variation for 11 stocks. The model explains 96% of the variance of the gap between the best buying and selling prices (the spread) and 76% of the variance of the price diffusion rate, with only one free parameter. We also study the market impact function, describing the response of quoted prices to the arrival of new orders. The nondimensional coordinates dictated by the model approximately collapse data from different stocks onto a single curve. This work is important from a practical point of view, because it demonstrates the existence of simple laws relating prices to order flows and, in a broader context, suggests there are circumstances where the strategic behavior of agents may be dominated by other considerations."

In this approach, economic phenomena emerge from the decentralized interactions among autonomous, heterogenous, boundedly rational, adaptive economic agents, rather than from idealized interactions among 'representative agents' or equilibrium analysis over the heads of the agents involved. In this paper, we study an industrial goods market, where buyers need to decide between making and buying components. Traditionally, Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) has been used to analyze these types of situations. However, a number of criticisms of TCE have been raised, which the ACE approach allows us to resolve. Our resulting Agent-based Computational Transaction Cost Economics (ACTCE) approach allows us to study systems of interacting agents both at the level with which TCE deals (allowing comparison and verification), as well as at the level of individual agents, allowing extension of the theory's predictive power."

The country's economic policy factors, the availability of various non-cash payments, and online sales and purchases, encourage the tendency to use non-cash transactions (e-payment). One way to find out these trends is to use a model. Models can help understand and explain real phenomena more easily and efficiently than directly observing. One model that can be used is Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS). By using ABMS, the development of models with complex behaviors, dependencies, and interactions can be developed more easily. ABMS is able to describe processes, phenomena, and situations. In this study, the factors that influence the tendency to use e-payment are obtained from various references. From these factors, then created a scenario as a sub-purpose of this model. In simulations using ABMS, detailed descriptions explained based on ODD Protocol elements can be more easily understood and complete. ODD systematically evaluates a model. The advantage is that ODD can improve the accuracy of model formulas and make the theoretical basis more visible."
SiggelkowNicolaj2003TDtC,,"Temporarily Divide to Conquer: Centralized, Decentralized, and Reintegrated Organizational Approaches to Exploration and Adaptation","Siggelkow, Nicolaj and Levinthal, Daniel A",2003,"Organization science (Providence, R.I.)",14,6,650-669,,,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"To create a competitive advantage, firms need to find activity configurations that are not only internally consistent, but also appropriate given the firm's current environment. This challenge is particularly acute after firms have experienced an environmental change that has shifted the existing competitive landscape and created new, high-performing sets of activity choices. How should firms organize to explore and search such an altered performance landscape? While it has been noted that adaptive entities need to maintain a balance of exploration and exploitation, little is known about how different organizational structures moderate this balance. With the help of an agentbased simulation model, we study the value of three different organizational structures: a centralized organization, in which decisions are made only at the level of the firm as a whole; a decentralized organization, in which decisions are made independently in two divisions; and a temporarily decentralized firm, which starts out with a decentralized structure and later reintegrates. We find that if interactions among a firm's activities are pervasive, neither the centralized nor the permanently decentralized organizational structure leads to high performance. In this case, temporary decentralizationan organizational structure that has not found much attention in the literatureyields the highest long-term performance. This organizational structure allows the firm both to avoid low-performing activity configurations and to eventually coordinate across its divisions. Thus, even if the decision problem a .rm faces is not fully decomposable, a temporary bifurcation can lead to a higher long-term performance outcome. Initial decentralized exploration is, however, costly in the short run, as compared to centralized exploration. As a result, a tradeoff exists between the short-term costs of decentralized exploration and the longterm benefits of reaching higher performance. As interactions across and within divisions increase, the optimal length of decentralized exploration tends to grow. Paralleling our first result, we further show that even if a decision problem is decomposable, that is, can be perfectly modularized, it can be beneficial to create a temporary decision allocation that creates ""unnecessary"" interdependencies across the subsystems. This benefit arises in particular when the modules are complex by themselves. In both cases, an initial phase of exploration, enabled by an appropriate organizational structure, followed by refinement and coordination, enabled by a different structure, leads to high performance. To illustrate our general model, we focus on incumbent firms' responses to the Internet and discuss implications for the product design process."
LiPuyang2022MLSC,,Modeling Land System Consequences of Estate-Smallholder Relationships in Central Tanzania,"Li, Puyang",2022,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Since 2007-2008, Africa has become the center of estate-driven land acquisitions to produce feed, food, biofuels, and fiber for the international market, which has raised contested narratives of African development and critical sustainability challenges. This is the case for the “Sisal Belt” of Kilosa in Tanzania, where Chinese firms resurrected former colonial sisal estates and generated wage labor for adjacent farmers, changing local agrarian structures with significant implications for smallholder cultivation and the environment at large. Land system science aims to understand the land use and land cover dynamics as a coupled social-environmental system, focusing on the spatiotemporal patterns and the underlying socioeconomic and environmental drivers, impacts, and feedbacks of land system change. Following this interest, this dissertation uses three empirical studies to understand the processes of land system transformation in the sisal belt region and examine the consequences of the co-development by the estate and smallholder agriculture. The first study conducts long-term time series land-cover mapping and remote sensing analysis via Google Earth Engine to detect land changes and their spatial and socio-economic linkages to estate operations and smallholder livelihoods. The second study applies agent-based modeling to assess the distinctions among smallholder households in land-use and livelihood decision-making mechanisms when confronting estate wage labor and cash crop opportunities. The third study quantifies and identifies critical tradeoffs between carbon, water services, and the outcomes of commodity economies based on distinct future scenarios of development visions and estate-smallholder relationships up to the year 2030.The findings of these studies advance the understanding of the human-environmental conditions of estate and smallholders in Tanzania under the African land rush underway, which is consistent with the interest of land system and sustainability sciences. The policy implications drawn from this dissertation suggest that the primary land users and decision-makers should recognize the history and realities of the existing agrarian systems and engage in creative ways that serve the estate and the smallholder, including improving smallholder production and localizing estate operations. Such policies should be informed by assessments of changes in the environment and its services and be guided by local knowledge, needs, and future aspirations."

In this paper, we present a mechanism for bridging the gap between individual agency and regional outcomes of that agency in simulation. We use agents to develop very rich behavioral understanding of their surroundings in simulation. We then sweep through the information that agents generate when determining how to execute their transition rules, using schemes that mine agent states to produce mental maps of varied aspects of their dynamics. From agents’ mental maps, we define and visualize regions as geographies that are conjured from the unique, autonomous, local, and personal insight that agents can provide. We demonstrate the utility of the scheme, with application to indoor movement scenarios in which fleeting regions form amid agents interactions with each other and their built surroundings. Our approach is extensible beyond these applications and could be of broader use for other explorative scenarios in regional science."

In this research, we propose an integrated framework that simultaneously investigates a broad range of social and economic factors on the diffusion dynamics of OSS using an Agent Based Computational Economics (ACE) approach. We find that interoperability costs, variability of OSS support costs, and duration of PS upgrade cycle are major determinants of OSS diffusion. Furthermore, there are interaction effects between network topology, network density and interoperability costs, which strongly influence the diffusion dynamics of OSS. The proposed model can be used as a building block to further investigate complex competitive dynamics in software markets."

An evolutionary economic approach is adopted by introducing decision rules that are applied routinely and an agent-based model is developed. Firms (the agents) can collaborate and create networks for research and development purposes. We have compared three collaboration strategies (A—peer-to-peer complementariness, B—concentration process and C—virtual cooperation networks) that were defined on the basis of literature and on empirical evidence. Strategies are introduced exogenously in the simulation. The aims of this paper are twofold: (i) to analyze the importance of the networking effects; and (ii) to test the differences among collaboration strategies. It was possible to conclude that profit is associated with higher stock of knowledge and with smaller network diameter. In addition, concentration strategies are more profitable and more efficient in transmitting knowledge through the network. These processes reinforce the stock of knowledge and the profit of the firms located in the centers of the networks."

In contrast to previous review studies, this review focuses on long-term time horizon (≥10 years) simulation-based cost-effectiveness analyses with homogeneous contexts of analysis (i.e. those with similar study objectives, comparators, and target populations) published over the past decade. By doing so, it provides a clearer picture of how modelling approaches taken in the existing studies truly differ across studies, and reveals major areas for improvement in conducting future cost-effectiveness analyses of DMTs for patients with MS."

We pursue our target developing an agent-based model in which the social network of interactions is specified as a knowledge resource, and knowledge integration is seen as the process by which the resource can be applied to innovation. The results of the simulation exercises show that the initial architecture of acquaintance networks is a crucial factor for innovation. Innovating has proven to be more than simply equating endowments of initial skills with firm performance. In fact, the performance of the system showed high sensitivity to the arrangement of the firm’s initial location in the social network. Moreover, the way in which acquaintance networks were mobilized emerged as a key determinant of innovation patterns. The model presented here is a relatively theoretical, stylized model and we employ it to draw some general, albeit preliminary conclusions, while illustrating some of the theory relevant to the issues discussed. It is argued that the model might serve the purpose of setting an agenda for further research along this line of investigation—that is, knowledge integration patterns and firms partnerships formation."

The use of agent based simulators encourages good software engineering design such as separation of concerns, that is, the uncoupling of the model description from its implementation detail. A major limitation in current approaches to ABM simulation is that of the trade off between simulator flexibility and performance. It is common that highly optimised simulations, such as those which target graphics processing units (GPU) hardware, are implemented as standalone software. This work presents a software framework (FLAME GPU 2) which balances flexibility with performance for general purpose ABM. Methods for ensuring high computational efficacy are demonstrated by, minimising data movement, and ensuring high device utilisation by exploiting opportunities for concurrent code execution within a model and through the use of ensembles of simulations. A novel hierarchical sub-modelling approach is also presented which can be used to model certain types of recursive behaviours. This feature is shown to be essential in providing a mechanism to resolve competition for resources between agents within a parallel environment which would otherwise introduce race conditions. To understand the performance characteristics of the software, a benchmark model with millions of agents is used to explore the use of simulation ensembles and to parametrically investigate concurrent code execution within a model. Performance speedups are demonstrated of 3.5 and 10 respectively over a baseline GPU implementation. Our hierarchical sub-modelling approach is used to demonstrate the implementation of a recursive algorithm to resolve competition of agent movement which occurs as a result of agent desire to simultaneously occupy discrete areas high in a ‘resource’. The algorithm is used to implement a classical socio-economics model, Sugarscape, with populations of up to 16M agents."

When the manager is less (more) risk-averse than the investors, managerial trading results in a less (more) volatile stock price and a lower (higher) risk premium. Trading between the manager and investors acts as an indirect renegotiation mechanism that dynamically modulates the managerʼs incentives and allocates risk and return, but its effectiveness is limited with dispersed small investors."

Workers invest some of their endowments into building up and fostering their social networks as an insurance device against future job losses. We look into the manner in which social networks and inequality respond to increased uncertainty in the labor market. We find that larger variability in firms’ labor demand reduces workers’ efforts put into social networks, leading to lower inequality."

First, what is the relative importance of different linkages in causing global financial crises? The second question concerns whether or not investor behaviour affects contagion. I use a two-market agent-based model that incorporates insights from behavioural finance to answer these open questions. Simulated managers only affect contagion when they control a small proportion of the total assets in each market. This evidence may partly explain the Russian contagion to Brazil where direct linkages did not exist. In addition, results show that global managers must make up between 40 and 50% of both local markets in order to become a more important linkage than that of international trade."

The market model has three features: (1) economic entities such as consumers and firms are regarded as autonomous agents; (2) micro interactions among consumer agents or firm agents have essential mechanisms interpretable in real markets; and (3) consumers’ preferences and firms’ technologies co-affect their evolutionary behavior. In recent years, consumers have experienced various inconveniences from de facto competition based on a market mechanism. Standardization communities or committees such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) need to design a compatible standard or a de jure standard in a market. However, it is difficult for market designers to decide a method or timing for the standardization. Here, by introducing a novel technique used in agent-based social simulation (ABSS), which we call “scenario analysis,” we aim to support such decision making. Scenario analysis provides the possible market changes that can occur following implementation of a design policy under a specific market situation and the market mechanisms that generate these market changes."

An agent-based simulation allows us to model three design elements and two contextual variables that have rarely been analyzed jointly: a vertical hierarchy that reviews proposals from subordinates, an incentive system that rewards subordinates for departmental or firm-wide performance, the decomposition of an organization's many decisions into departments, the underlying pattern of interactions among decisions, and limits on the ability of managers to process information. Interdependencies arise among these features because of a basic, general tension. To be successful, an organization must broadly search for good sets of decisions, but it must also stabilize around good decisions once discovered. An effective organization balances search and stability. We identify sets of design elements that encourage broad search and others that promote stability. The adoption of elements that encourage broad search typically raises the marginal benefit of other elements that provide offsetting stability. Hence, the need to balance search and stability generates interdependencies among the design elements. We pay special attention to interdependencies that involve the vertical hierarchy. Our findings confirm many aspects of conventional wisdom about vertical hierarchies, but challenge or put boundary conditions on others. We place limits, for instance, on the received wisdom that firm-wide incentives and capable subordinates make top-level oversight less valuable. We also identify circumstances in which vertical hierarchies can lead to inferior long-term performance."

Lately, the extent of virtualization has enabled full-fledged cloud solution to become affordable, quantitatively and/or qualitatively. The purpose of this study is to explore the former in detail. In this paper, implementation of cloud-based services in the financial services, intermediaries and banking industry where security has always been the greatest concern are studied through actor-based stakeholder modelling. Drivers for adoption, benefits and trade-offs and challenges have been discussed in detail through a hypothetical comprehensive case study of a bank. Design/methodology/approach An actor-dependency-based technique for analyzing and modelling requirements prior to changes and charting out roadmap and rationale behind it all has been used. Through the use of i* modelling, dependencies and relationships between various stakeholders have been studied. Further, how decision makers in the financial services industry evaluate, consolidate and finally migrate to a new architecture is also explored. Findings Two hypothetical use cases on a hypothetical bank referred to as “The Bank” illustrate the technique and possible roadmap for implementation. Originality/value To the best of knowledge in the public domain, no similar work has been carried out with the perspective of modelling stakeholders and change management configuration in the financial services using cloud. This approach is valuable for augmenting technological advancements with business insights and spotting value in synergies of the sectors whenever and wherever apparent."

Contemporary tight carbon reduction targets urge the need to deploy renewable energy technologies however due to interdependencies across the WEF nexus, various technologies are beneficial for some but not all sectors. This paper quantifies the impacts of future possible AD technology diffusion choices on the environment, society and economy. This can aid decision makers to identify the potential consequences of various AD alternatives within the next three decades. The study considers an integrated WEF nexus approach and accounts for the interdependencies within the nexus. This was done by developing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) and simulating the relations between the main players within the nexus, thus examining the upscaling of AD diffusion and its consequences for water consumption, energy production, transportation, landfill use, food waste processing and digestate generation. Three future WEF nexus scenarios, that reflect potential alternatives of society and technology in Great Britain up to 2050, were utilised by the ABM implementation to test the sensitivity of AD diffusion choices. These scenarios describe possible changes to lifestyle, governance, technologies, climate, and social structures. Accounting for the uncertainty associated with such future simulations, the Monte Carlo method was employed to estimate the potential variations in scenario outputs. Results suggest that decentralisation results in the largest carbon reduction, but can incur more costs. Centralisation consumes 35% more water but produces 37% more energy (biogas). The paper has visualised the scenario outputs graphically to highlight the consequences of neglecting the inter-relationships between environmental, social and economic aspects of AD. •The future diffusion of AD plants in GB was simulated using an Agent-Based model.•Future energy scenarios were utilised to reflect different lifestyles and economies.•Intersectoral complex dependencies in the water-energy-food nexus were considered.•Impacts of AD implementation on environment, society and economy were quantified.•Trade-offs were assessed between the impacts of centralised & decentralised scenarios."

We introduce a framework for ex-ante assessment of the impact of land management policies and interventions and for quantifying their impacts on land-based mitigation and adaptation goals. The framework includes a companion modelling (ComMod) process informed by interviews with policymakers, local experts and local farmers. The ComMod process consists of a Role-Playing Game with local farmers and an Agent Based Model. The game provided a participatory means to develop policy and climate change scenarios. These scenarios were then used as inputs to the Agent Based Model, a spatially explicit model to simulate landscape dynamics and the associated carbon emissions over decades. We applied the framework using as case study a community in central Vietnam, characterized by deforestation for subsistence agriculture and cultivation of acacias as a cash crop. The main findings show that the framework is useful in guiding consideration of local stakeholders' goals, needs and constraints.

HerzbergerAnnaJean2020TRoI,,The Role of International Soybean Trade in Telecoupled Human and Natural Systems,"Herzberger, Anna Jean",2020,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"International food trade and globalized agriculture production connects humans and the environment around the world. As consumption demands are increasingly met abroad by importing food products, environmental and socioeconomic effects of production are left in the producing region, while the effects on the importing countries’ domestic production remain understudied due to the complexity and low visibility of the impacts. As population growth increases the caloric demand and rising affluence drives changes in consumption patterns, connections via food trade will continue to increase. Therefore, to identify local impacts of global phenomena, this dissertation analyses the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of international soybean trade within Brazil (e.g., largest producer), China (e.g., largest consumer) and the U.S. (e.g., the former largest producer). Drawing from both natural and social science disciplines, global trade data, satellite-imagery, farmer interviews and soil samples were combined for an interdisciplinary assessment of how international soybean trade couples distant human and the environment systems, the true extent of land-use change driven by soybean trade and the resulting impacts within each respective country. Chapter 1 provides a review of the published literature and background on international soybean trade and production. In chapter 2, the influence of China’s soybean demand was measured on Brazil’s production and trade. The results suggest that export-oriented soybean expansion in Brazil displaced the production of other crops and increased imports from nearby countries. For chapter 3, the impact of imported soybeans on production in China’s main agricultural region was explored. Competition from imported soybeans has resulted in many farmers switching cultivation to corn or to abandon farming in search of more lucrative options. This cultivation shift requires changes in management that involve increased nitrogen inputs and residual crop biomass – both of which have resulted in environmental spillovers. Chapter 4 furthered the analysis by considering the impacts of farmer cultivation and management decisions on soil properties. Soil texture, pH, total organic carbon and 16S rRNA gene sequence were used in combination with detailed farmer management surveys to understand how changes in residue management effect efficiency, productivity, profitability and sustainability of the system. The results indicated that the accumulation of residual corn biomass has increased the use of residue fires and decreased the amount of crop residue being returned to the soil. The culminating chapter used an agent-based modeling (ABM) to integrate the above chapters into a TeleABM. The teleABM models land use change in Brazil and China based on global soybean demand. Land-use change decisions are made by farmer agents which have parametrized using the farmer interviews. Next, the farmer agent cultivation and management decisions have environmental impacts that were determined by analyzing the soil samples under the context of management decisions. Finally, production and the impact of farmer agent decisions on the soil properties feedback to the farmer’s future cultivation and management decisions. Because of the economic, environmental and political importance of international soybean trade, the results of this dissertation are of great interest for future soybean production and trade between the specified countries as well as food security and environmental sustainability across the world."

Likewise, production models assume that prices are known a-priori. In reality prices depend on variable demands and supplies, while demand and supply depend on variable prices, and these two processes are interconnected. This paper describes a model that for the first time simulates a combined agent-based double auction market and production model. The model is built around von Neumann technology matrices (von Neumann, Rev Econ Stud 13(1):1–9, 1946 ) which provide the links between products. Agents possess one or more technologies to produce products from other products. They trade in order to acquire the inputs and sell in order to generate revenue, and the price is determined by a process of negotiation between buyers and sellers. The algorithm of negotiation is based on Cliff’s Zero Intelligence Plus approach (Cliff, Minimal-intelligence agents for bargaining behaviors in market-based environments. Technical report, School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, University of Sussex, 1997 ), but instead of a single commodity with fixed limit prices the agents change their limit prices for multiple products based on the simulated economic situation. The combination of production and market provides a simple but complete bottom-up model framework for microeconomics. As the results show, the model employs a price mechanism that results in an appropriate allocation of resources without a central command."

The model is used to perform monetary policy experiments. A monetary policy rule which targets the gap between the current output and the potential output in the full employment case is investigated, studying the effects on the economy for different degrees of policy tightness. The monetary policy rule is compared to a random policy rule that conserves a similar structure. Results show that a tight monetary policy clearly over performs the random policy rule. Moreover, results corroborate the effectiveness of monetary policy in limiting inflation and increasing welfare."

This paper presents an agent-based financial market model and simulations in which agents follow technical and fundamental trading rules to determine their speculative investment positions. The model developed by Westerhoff (2009) was chosen for implementation and was extended by FTT and arising transaction costs. Because FTTs may be defined in various ways, this paper defines assets as tax objects. The model includes direct interactions between speculators, which may lead them to decide to change their trading behavior and addresses a technical and a fundamental strategy of market participants. The results suggest that the modified model has a tendency to stabilize itself in the long term if fundamental trading rules outweigh the technical trading method. This model could be used when bubbles and crashes occur in financial markets. Asset prices would be stabilized because their value targets near the fundamental value and volatility would also be minimized. Setting FTTs at a low rate for market stabilization is important. If FTTs and consequent transaction costs are too high, then the financial system will destabilize and prices will grow without limit. The model described in this paper explores dependence market stability to the extent of FTTs. However, the model should not be interpreted as a model only for the introduction of FTT, but as a general model of transaction costs' influence on the financial market."

Diffusion is modeled as the result of idiosyncratic adoption thresholds, local network effects and information diffusion (broadcasting and demonstration effect from previous adopters). A high social cohesion decreases the probability of one innovation cornering the market. Nonetheless, with imperfect information, in small-world networks the higher speed of diffusion produced by the low average distance increases this probability. A low social cohesion also increases the probability of falling into traps of under-adoption. However, such probability is significantly lower with imperfect information, because such regime is characterized by higher levels of market concentrations and this reduces the frictions due to the coexistence of non-compatible product innovations."

PrietoD.2016Aoem,,An operational epidemiological model for calibrating agent-based simulations of pandemic influenza outbreaks,"Prieto, D. and Das, T. K.",2016,Health care management science,19,1,19-Jan,,,Springer US,New York,"Uncertainty of pandemic influenza viruses continue to cause major preparedness challenges for public health policymakers. Decisions to mitigate influenza outbreaks often involve tradeoff between the social costs of interventions (e.g., school closure) and the cost of uncontrolled spread of the virus. To achieve a balance, policymakers must assess the impact of mitigation strategies once an outbreak begins and the virus characteristics are known. Agent-based (AB) simulation is a useful tool for building highly granular disease spread models incorporating the epidemiological features of the virus as well as the demographic and social behavioral attributes of tens of millions of affected people. Such disease spread models provide excellent basis on which various mitigation strategies can be tested, before they are adopted and implemented by the policymakers. However, to serve as a testbed for the mitigation strategies, the AB simulation models must be operational . A critical requirement for operational AB models is that they are amenable for quick and simple calibration. The calibration process works as follows: the AB model accepts information available from the field and uses those to update its parameters such that some of its outputs in turn replicate the field data. In this paper, we present our epidemiological model based calibration methodology that has a low computational complexity and is easy to interpret. Our model accepts a field estimate of the basic reproduction number, and then uses it to update (calibrate) the infection probabilities in a way that its effect combined with the effects of the given virus epidemiology, demographics, and social behavior results in an infection pattern yielding a similar value of the basic reproduction number. We evaluate the accuracy of the calibration methodology by applying it for an AB simulation model mimicking a regional outbreak in the US. The calibrated model is shown to yield infection patterns closely replicating the input estimates of the basic reproduction number. The calibration method is also tested to replicate an initial infection incidence trend for a H1N1 outbreak like that of 2009."
BurtonVanessaClaire2020Vfwe,,Visions for woodland expansion in 21st Century Scotland: alternative governance strategies and ecosystem service implications,"Burton, Vanessa Claire",2020,,,,,,,The University of Edinburgh,,"In order to tackle global challenges including climate change, biodiversity and habitat loss, deforestation and forest degradation, land system research needs to support decision making which helps to develop sustainable land use systems. In a Scottish context woodland expansion and multi-functionality in terms of ecosystem service (ES) provision are core aims of land use policy. However, there are conflicting objectives between stakeholders and research has struggled to quantify the synergies and trade-offs between these. There is a lack of understanding in terms of how to achieve ES multi-functionality, as well as considerable uncertainty with regards to the continuation of public support for different land uses after Brexit. This thesis aimed to understand the synergies and trade-offs between ES generated by woodland expansion under alternative stakeholder ‘visions’ – or ‘positive descriptions of ideal futures.’ Through exploring how these visions might be met, it also examined how governance might influence woodland expansion and ES provision. An interdisciplinary approach was adopted, combining evidence synthesis, stakeholder engagement, and agent-based modelling (ABM) to explore the effect of alternative stakeholder visions for woodland expansion on ES provision. In Chapter 2, a systematic review of evidence for the effect of woodland expansion on biodiversity and ecosystem services in a UK context found that currently the largest body of evidence exists for the effects of conifer plantations, and public benefits such as carbon sequestration and flood regulation. Evidence gaps need to be filled in relation to a broader consideration of taxa and metrics for biodiversity, natural regeneration of native woodland, and effects on cultural and provisioning ES. Chapter 3 presents a mixed-method approach combining document analysis, a stakeholder workshop and semi-structured interviews, resulting in five distinct ‘visions’ for how woodland expansion might ideally take place. These illustrated a great deal of common ground between high-level stakeholders, but also important distinctions in terms of overall objectives, priority ES, and governance mechanisms with which visions might be achieved. In chapters 4 and 5, an established ABM framework was adapted to describe a new model, CRAFTY-Scotland. The elicited visions were represented within the model, in order to explore the ES implications and likelihood of meeting Scottish government targets for woodland expansion. Findings suggest that ABM offers a useful method for exploring normative visions, taking into account multiple ES and quantifying trade-offs between non-economic values. The results suggest that there could be largely positive effects of woodland expansion on ecosystem services, across visions. Trade-offs are quantified relating to declines in livestock and floral species diversity. However, all ecosystem services results are strongly dependent on the current data, knowledge, and modelling choices. Willingness of traditional and sporting estate managers to diversify has a strong influence on whether or not woodland cover targets are met. Key barriers to achieving targets appear to be the continued dominance of marginal agriculture and single-use management in the Highlands. Of the governance mechanisms represented within the model, the most successful include targeted annualised incentives for woodlands, diversified land management, and increased financial, human and social resources for local communities. Together, the findings suggest that more significant changes may be required to meet targets for woodland expansion, particularly in relation to highly valued ‘traditional’ Scottish landscapes. Any such changes should be debated at regional levels in participatory applications. Modelling approaches of this kind, combining spatially explicit data together with processes and governance of the land use system, are currently under-utilised and offer valuable decision support tools if built upon further. Given the urgent need to move towards sustainable land use in the face of multiple challenges, linking societal visions to models in research approaches which engage society with science and encourage futures thinking have great potential."

Methods: A decision model was developed to simulate progression-free and overall survival in mCRC patients receiving chemotherapy with and without the new drug. Costs for chemotherapy and side-effects management were obtained from both public and private hospitals in India. Utility estimates measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were determined by interviewing twenty-four oncology nurses using the Time Trade-Off technique. The monthly cost of the new drug was then estimated using a target threshold of US$9,300 per QALY gained, which is three times the Indian per capita GDP. Results: The base-case analysis suggested that a price of US$98.00 per dose would be considered cost-effective from the Indian public healthcare perspective. If the drug were able to improve patient quality of life above the standard of care or survival from 3 to 6 months, the price per dose could increase to US$170 and US$253 and offer the same value. Conclusions: The use of the WHO criteria for estimating the cost of a new drug based on economic value for a developing country like India is feasible and can be used to estimate a more affordable cost based on societal value thresholds."

[eng] The Roman economy has been defined as an agrarian regime, where wheat was mainly cultivated combined with livestock farming and intensive cash crops such as wine and olive oil. Possibilities for economic growth in a winegrowing area such as the Laetanian region in Hispania Citerior depended upon changes in agrarian productivity but were subject to agro-ecological and agroeconomic endowments that could affect the settlement patterns, the fluctuations in population, the forms of production related to the vineyard crop capacities, the spread of new techniques of cultivation and processing and the adoption of new technological advances. The combination of these factors explains how comparative advantages arose from other wine- growing territories, achieved through intensification and specialization processes that generated an increase of winemaking production surplus capable of being traded in different overseas markets. The intensive viticulture practised during the Roman period in the ancient Laetanian region situated in the centre of Catalan coastal depression was a widespread phenomenon with huge economic implications which represented a cultural revolution for this territory in all areas and at all orders. This research project builds on a previous work where was established the theoretical and epistemological framework of study of the different variables, factors and endogenous and exogenous agents involved in every stage of the production, distribution, trade and consumption of wine in the Roman period between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD (Martín i Oliveras, 2015b). This new work is focused on a geospatial and geoeconomic analysis, which supposes the identification of the settlement patterns, the organization of the rural habitat, the forms of production and management related to the crops capacities to obtain optimal yields for generating surpluses in a context of a growing population. The utilization of quantitative and qualitative methods such as mathematics, statistics and linear programming models like PM-Predictive Modeling, CFD-Cumulative Frequency Distribution Modeling, ABM-Agent Based Modeling and CSN-Complex Systems Networks, allows us to interpret and make predictions, regressions, and reconstructions about the evolution of the wine economy, understood as a situation that includes all the aspects needed to produce wines of various qualities, along with a group of complementary activities related to the production, elaboration, distribution, trade and consumption.

Critical to transmission control are HIV prevention strategies with new interventions continuing to be developed. Mathematical models are important for understanding the potential impact of these interventions and supporting policy decisions. This systematic review aims to answer the following question: when a new HIV prevention intervention is being considered or designed, what information regarding it is necessary to include in a compartmental model to provide useful insights to policy makers? The primary objective of this review is therefore to assess suitability of current compartmental HIV prevention models for informing policy development. Methods Articles published in EMBASE, Medline, Econlit, and Global Health were screened. Included studies were identified using permutations of (i) HIV, (ii) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), circumcision (both voluntary male circumcision [VMMC] and early-infant male circumcision [EIMC]), and vaccination, and (iii) modelling. Data extraction focused on study design, model structure, and intervention incorporation into models. Article quality was assessed using the TRACE (TRAnsparent and Comprehensive Ecological modelling documentation) criteria for mathematical models. Results Of 837 articles screened, 48 articles were included in the review, with 32 unique mathematical models identified. The substantial majority of studies included PrEP (83%), whilst fewer modelled circumcision (54%), and only a few focussed on vaccination (10%). Data evaluation, implementation verification, and model output corroboration were identified as areas of poorer model quality. Parameters commonly included in the mathematical models were intervention uptake and effectiveness, with additional intervention-specific common parameters identified. We identified key modelling gaps; critically, models insufficiently incorporate multiple interventions acting simultaneously. Additionally, population subgroups were generally poorly represented—with future models requiring improved incorporation of ethnicity and sexual risk group stratification—and many models contained inappropriate data in parameterisation which will affect output accuracy. Conclusions This review identified gaps in compartmental models to date and suggests areas of improvement for models focusing on new prevention interventions. Resolution of such gaps within future models will ensure greater robustness and transparency, and enable more accurate assessment of the impact that new interventions may have, thereby providing more meaningful guidance to policy makers."

Our study of this system documents a phase transition between a sub-critical and a super-critical regime based on the values of a coupling constant that modulates the tradeoff between local majority and global minority forces. In conclusion, we offer a speculative socioeconomic interpretation of the resulting distributional properties of the system."

Wade",2014,Computational economics,43,1,33-51,,,Springer US,Boston,"Auction sellers can use a reserve price to require a minimum bid before items are sold. Theoretical and experimental research has tested the influence of a reserve price in an independent private values auction, but little focus has been given to the influence of a reserve price in a first-price common-value auction. We establish an agent-based first-price common-value auction to determine the impact of the reserve price with two buyers and with three buyers. An agent-based approach to this problem is both a unique contribution to the literature and appropriate since finding analytical solutions with common-value auctions is difficult. The agent-based model approach also allows us to consider buyers that have non-symmetric bid functions. Furthermore, we introduce a combination of numerical integration techniques with a new particle swarm learning algorithm. The buyers in the model choose their expected-net-revenue-maximizing bid price, and sellers choose their expected-revenue-maximizing reserve price. In the two-buyer and three-buyer auction, a reserve price increases the equilibrium winning bid price, decreases the probability that the item is sold, and increases the seller’s expected revenue. A reserve price in a two-buyer auction increases the winning bid price more than including an additional buyer in the auction with no reserve price. However, due to only receiving a salvage value when the item does not sell in the auction, the seller’s expected revenue is higher in the three-buyer first-price common-value auction without a reserve price than in the two-buyer auction with a reserve price."

BrughmansTom2016MaAM,,MERCURY: an Agent-Based Model of Tableware Trade in the Roman East,"Brughmans, Tom and Poblome, Jeroen",2016,Journal of artificial societies and social simulation,19,1,1-,,,J A S S S,GUILDFORD,"A large number of complex hypotheses exists that aim to explain aspects of the Roman economy, consisting of many explanatory factors that are argued to affect each other. Such complex hypotheses cannot be compared or tested through the traditional practice of qualitative argumentation and comparison with selected small sets of written and material sources alone. Moreover, these hypotheses often draw on different conceptual frameworks to abstract the same past phenomenon under study, hampering formal comparison. There is a need in the study of the Roman economy for more formal computational modelling for representing and comparing the many existing conceptual models, and for testing their ability to explain patterns observed in archaeological data where possible. This paper aims to address this need. It argues that communicating the potential contribution of computational modelling to scholars of the Roman economy should focus on providing theoretically well-founded arguments for the selection of the included and excluded variables, the conceptualisation used, and to address those elements of conceptual models that are at the forefront of scholarly debates. This approach is illustrated in this paper through MERCURY (Market Economy and Roman Ceramics Redistribution, after the Roman patron god of commerce), an agent-based model (ABM) of ceramic tableware trade in the Roman East. MERCURY presents a representation of two conflicting conceptual models of the degree of market integration in the Roman Empire, both of which serve as potential explanations for the empirically observed strong differences in the distribution patterns of tablewares. This paper illustrates how concepts derived from network science can be used to abstract both conceptual models, to implement these in an ABM and to formally compare them. The results of experiments with MERCURY suggest that limited degrees of market integration are unlikely to result in wide tableware distributions and strong differences between the tableware distributions. We conclude that in order for the discussion on the functioning of the Roman economy to progress, authors of conceptual models should (a) clearly define the concepts used and discuss exactly how these differ from the concepts used by others, (b) make explicit how these concepts can be represented as data, (c) describe the expected behaviour of the system using the defined concepts, (d) describe the expected data patterns resulting from this behaviour, and (d) define how (if at all) archaeological and historical sources can be used as reflections or proxies of these expected data patterns."

Funding decisions for these therapies requires weighing up their effectiveness and costs. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of monotherapy with oral PAH-specific therapies versus supportive care as initial therapy for patients with functional class (FC) II and III PAH in Canada. Methods A cost-utility analysis, from the perspective of a healthcare system and based on a Markov model, was designed to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with bosentan, ambrisentan, riociguat, tadalafil, sildenafil and supportive care for PAH in treatment-naïve patients. Separate analyses were conducted for cohorts of patients commencing therapy at FC II and III PAH. Transition probabilities, based on the relative risk of improving and worsening in FC with treatment versus placebo, were derived from a recent network meta-analysis. Utility values and costs were obtained from published data and clinical expert opinion. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results Analysis suggests that sildenafil is the most cost-effective therapy for PAH in patients with FC II or III. Sildenafil was both the least costly and most effective therapy, thereby dominating all other treatments. Tadalafil was also less costly and more effective than supportive care in FC II and III; however, sildenafil was dominant over tadalafil. Even given the uncertainty within the clinical inputs, the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that apart from sildenafil and tadalafil, the other PAH therapies had negligible probability of being the most cost effective. Conclusion The results show that initiation of therapy with sildenafil is likely the most cost-effective strategy in PAH patients with either FC II or III disease."

In both trials, progression-free survival was increased in the R-FC treatment groups compared with the FC treatment groups. In CLL-8, overall survival was also significantly increased. Objective To develop an economic model to assess the cost effectiveness, from the Australian healthcare perspective, of rituximab when used as a treatment for both previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. Methods A Markov model with three health states (unprogressed, progressed and death) was developed to extrapolate the trial results over a 15-year time horizon. A treatment algorithm was developed with Australian haematologists to inform the treatments to be modelled. The base-case compares up to three courses of six cycles of R-FC (‘first-line’ treatment) followed by three courses of post-progression salvage (‘Salvage’) treatment (including rituximab) with three courses of FC followed by three courses of Salvage treatment (excluding rituximab). Subsequent treatments are incorporated into the model by repeating the unprogressed and progressed health states for each treatment. Time-dependent transition probabilities for the model were estimated from an analysis of individual patient data from CLL-8 and REACH. Comparisons of the hazard rates for the CLL-8 and REACH trials enabled an assessment of the impact on the transitions of receiving the same regimen as the first or second treatment, and hence inform assumptions regarding transitions for third and subsequent treatments. Costs applied in the model were based on published Australian prices in 2009. Results The model predicts patients receive an average of approximately two courses of treatment, and the addition of rituximab results in an incremental gain of 0.94 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost associated with the addition of rituximab is A$40,268, and hence the cost per QALY gained (QALYG) is A$42,906. Conclusion Rituximab, in combination with chemotherapy, when used multiple times throughout the treatment algorithm, appears to be cost effective for CLL from the Australian healthcare perspective, with a cost/QALYG within the range generally accepted as providing value."

However, in an attempt to represent realistic decision-making processes, spatial ABMs often become extremely complex, making it difficult to identify and quantify sources of model sensitivity. This paper implements a coastal version of the economic agent-based urban growth model, CHALMS, to investigate both space- and time-varying sensitivities of simulated coastal development dynamics. We review the current state of spatially- and temporally-explicit global sensitivity analyses (GSA) for environmental modeling in general, and build on the innovative but nascent efforts to implement these approaches with complex spatial ABMs. Combined variance- and density-based approaches to GSA were used to investigate the partitioning, magnitude, and directionality of model output variance. Time-varying GSA revealed sensitivity of multiple outputs to storm frequency and cyclical patterns of sensitivity for other input parameters. Spatially-explicit GSA showed diverging sensitivities at landscape versus (smaller-scale) zonal levels, reflecting trade-offs in residential housing consumer location decisions and spatial 'spill-over' interactions. More broadly, when transitioning from a conceptual to empirically parameterized model, sensitivity analysis is a helpful step to prioritize parameters for data collection, particularly when data collection is costly. These findings illustrate unique challenges of and need to perform comprehensive sensitivity analysis with dynamic, spatial ABMs."

Experimental results demonstrate that: (a) faster financial trading agents can reduce market efficiency—a worrying result given the race towards zero-latency (ever faster trading) observed in real markets; and (b) faster agents can lead to market fragmentation, such that markets transition from a regime where humans and agents freely interact to a regime where agents are more likely to trade between themselves—a result that has also been observed in real financial markets. It is also shown that (c) realism in experimental design can significantly alter market dynamics—suggesting that, if we want to understand complexity in real financial markets, it is finally time to move away from the simple experimental economics models first introduced in the 1960s."
CarpenterMasonA.2003Tamo,,"Testing a model of reasoned risk-taking: governance, the experience of principals and agents, and global strategy in high-technology IPO firms","Carpenter, Mason A. and Pollock, Timothy G. and Leary, Myleen M.",2003,Strategic management journal,24,9,803-820,,,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","Chichester, UK","Research on the governance of risky ventures, like the initial public offerings (IPOs) of high-technology firms, has focused primarily on the relationship between governance mechanisms and firm performance. While such an emphasis is clearly important, it does little to shed light on potential relationships between governance and the strategies pursued by risky firms, nor does it take into account the complementary role of key stakeholders in affecting those strategies. To partially remedy this deficit we integrate agency and behavioral perspectives to develop a theory of 'reasoned risk-taking,' whereby the nature of risks undertaken is a consequence of the interaction of governance mechanisms and stakeholder characteristics. We demonstrate our theory by predicting when corporate governance should be associated with strategic risk-seeking beyond a firm's technical core--as seen in the degree to which it has expanded internationally. Surprisingly, even though venture capitalists (VC) are risk specialists, we find that technology-based IPO firms are less likely (i.e., a negative relationship) to have extensive global sales when they are backed by a VC. In support of our reasoned risk-taking theoretical framework, we find that VCs are indeed risk-seeking when VC backing is complemented by the international experience of their board appointees, top management team (TMT) members, or both. IPO firms with significant insider ownership are similarly global risk-seekers, and those effects are strongest with an internationally seasoned board and TMT at the helm."
ZhangMinqi2023Eaee,,Ergonomic and economic evaluation of a collaborative hybrid order picking system,"Zhang, Minqi and Grosse, Eric H. and Glock, Christoph H.",2023,International journal of production economics,258,,108774-,,,Elsevier B.V,AMSTERDAM,"Warehouses are important nodes in almost every supply chain. Within warehouses, order picking is a crucial task that is extremely time- and cost-intensive. While order picking systems (OPSs) have traditionally been operated manually, new technologies offer opportunities for reducing the workload of warehouse workers. These technologies include autonomous picking robots that can function in combination with human pickers within a shared workspace. This technology enables human–robot collaboration and enhances flexibility in system design, as robots can either support humans or work independently. Research on the advantages of these hybrid OPSs (HOPSs) for improving operational performance is still scarce, however. To contribute to closing this research gap, we propose an agent-based simulation model to investigate how HOPSs reduce the daily workload of human order pickers. The results reveal that HOPSs – if certain assignment rules for the picking tasks are considered – can reduce both the operational costs of the system and human workload compared to a pure manual or a fully automated OPS. Nonetheless, attention should be paid to control the item weight pickers are supposed to handle, as HOPSs reduce the travel distance of human pickers, resulting in a higher frequency of picking activities and an increased ergonomic risk for musculoskeletal disorders."

Writing a dissertation composed of three distinct case studies, two from the U.S. Southwest and one from the south of France, I use tools developed in complexity science to better address how people in prehistory dealt with challenges related to resource acquisition.

Understanding the factors that influence the AEC's adoption of BIM will benefit the research and practice of BIM. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study provides empirical evidence for the accumulated knowledge of BIM adoption by examining the context of Chinese construction industry. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework in the innovation diffusion literature, the authors develop a research model that integrates the critical success factors related to the technology of BIM, the construction company and the environment in Chinese construction industry. The authors collected two different data sets from engineering consulting firms and construction firms in China, and conducted rigorous analyses using a sophisticated statistical approach. Findings - The authors found that the relative advantage of BIM was a major factor that enabled BIM adoption, while the complexity of BIM was an inhibiter. In addition, management support was also a significant antecedent of BIM adoption. However, organizational readiness was significant for engineering consulting firms but not for construction firms. Surprisingly, the authors did not find consistent significant impacts of any environmental factors. Last, younger firms were more likely to adopt BIM. Originality/value - One of the first to apply the TOE framework to integrate three groups of factors that may explain BIM adoption in China. Such a comprehensive framework provides a much broader perspective of BIM adoption to evaluate the impacts of different antecedent factors. The authors conducted an empirical study based on survey data collected from two different types of companies, i.e., engineering consulting firms and construction firms, representing the two parties in the principal-agent relationship of a construction project. One of the first to apply a sophisticated statistical approach, i.e., partial least squares, to analyze the data in the BIM literature."

The robustness and speed of the PSO algorithm is compared to a genetic algorithm (GA) in a Cournot oligopsony market. Artificial agents with the PSO learning algorithm find the optimal strategies that are predicted by theory. PSO is simpler and more robust to changes in algorithm parameters than GA. PSO also converges faster and gives more precise answers than the GA method which was used by some previous economic studies.
AbdelshafieAlaa2023MtCo,,Managing the Complexity of Empty Container Movements Through Repositioning Strategies and Routing Practices Under Certain Demand and Supply,"Abdelshafie, Alaa",2023,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Over the past decades, container transportation management has become an important part of the global maritime industry. Due to an ever-increasing movement of containers across the globe in line with the economic boom, the trade imbalance and issues related to empty containers have become inevitable. The accumulation of empty containers in specific ports not only causes a waste of money but also increases the environmental footprint. Accordingly, the urgent need for empty container management has been gaining more attention than ever before, as the shipping companies recognized that more revenues are always derived from a good repositioning strategy. In this respect, this thesis described state-of-the-art of empty container management, focusing on the practices concerning the movement of empty containers that are varied between organizational policies, technical solutions, and optimization applications. With the development of computer-aided systems, the combination of optimization and simulation models has been proposed to tackle the maritime empty container problem. The thesis shows how the strengths of optimization-based simulation can be integrated to provide high-quality solutions with low computational costs. Agent-based modelling was developed to model the global movements of empty containers, providing realistic details of interactions among entities and characteristics of components within the system. The model was applied between ports in the Middle East and Asia for one of the biggest shipping lines worldwide. By using simulated annealing (SA), the best sequence for moving containers can be determined. The results comparison demonstrate that the proposed optimised repositioning strategy can significantly reduce the shipping line’s costs and make full use of empty containers in the planning horizon."

We develop a dynamic discrete/continuous choice model of car holding duration for forward-looking agents. We estimate this model using French panel survey data. Our findings indicate that a household’s time preference is a crucial element in car use and holding decisions."

In our study, an adaptive allocation model was established for a complex system of regional water and land resources using complex adaptive systems theory. The users of water and land resources were treated as adaptive agents, and the competition and synergy among various agents toward water and land resources were used as the driving forces for the evolution of the model. The model was accurately solved using a nested genetic algorithm to achieve the optimal joint allocation of regional water and land resources. A case study was conducted in the city of Kiamusze in Heilongjiang Province, and the results indicated that the evolution of the model was consistent with the actual behaviors of adaptive agents. Moreover, after the implementation of the optimized allocation results, the economic benefits in the study area were expected to increase by 3.34 %, and the comprehensive user satisfaction index regarding water increased from 0.61 to 0.73; moreover, the ecological footprint of the ecological sector increased by 5.6 %. Our results provide important guidance for achieving the sustainable use of regional water and land resources."

B, Urban analytics and city science",51,3,590-609,,,SAGE Publications,"London, England","This study develops an agent-based model of urban transition, U-TRANS, with coupled housing and labour markets to simulate the transition of a city during a major industrial shift. We propose a dynamic, bottom-up framework incorporating the key interacting factors and micro mechanisms that drive the transition paths of cities. Using U-TRANS, we simulate a number of distinctive urban transition paths, from total collapse to weak recovery to enhanced training to global recruit, and analyse the resulting outcomes on economic growth, employment, inequality, housing price and the local neighbourhoods. We find that poor neighbourhoods benefit the most from growth in the new industry, whereas rich neighbourhoods do better than the rest when growth stagnates and the city declines. We also find there is a subtle trade-off between growth and equality in development strategy. By aggressively recruiting a large number of skilled workers from outside of the city in a short time, the division between local and non-local workers can be widened. The study contributes to the understanding of the dynamic process and micro mechanisms underlying urban transition. It helps explain why some cities starting from seemingly similar initial conditions may go on divergent development paths at critical moments in the history. It also demonstrates the heterogeneous impact of industrial shift on different urban neighbourhoods. The model can be used as a policy testbed for different development strategies to help cities navigate through a major industrial revolution."

Apart from all benefits it has to human beings; this process is associated with some problems such as air pollution and high transportation cost. The logistic costs of collecting and transporting waste wood cause considerable challenges regarding scale, geography of supplier location, sustainability of supply chain, etc. Given these research challenges, this work contributes to the existing literature by developing an integrated Geographical Information System (GIS) and Agent-based simulation modeling to assess the effect of intermodal transportation (truck and train) technology developments (capacity and size) of the woody biomass supply chain (BSC) on the environmental emissions and cost. This work aims at analyzing and quantifying the environmental emissions and economic cost of woody waste BSC transportation design. The developed model is tested on the case study in Victoria-Australia. Results showed that a combination of truck and train transport with increasing size and capacity of container leads to decreasing near 60% gaseous pollutant emissions. Changing the capacity of the containers from light to medium and heavy would lead to reducing the cumulative emissions by an averagely of 46% and 59%, respectively. Finally, the sensitivity analysis results revealed that using 100% truck transportation leads to the highest emission cost for BSC. Using 80% train transportation mode by suppliers would reduce emissions by 58%."

J.",2014,International journal of service industry management,25,1,125-148,,,Emerald Group Publishing,BINGLEY,"Purpose - Personnel turnover entails considerable costs and is a major problem for the call center industry. By modifying the job demands-resources model, this study aims to examine how emotional exhaustion and organizational pride affect turnover intentions. In addition, it investigates how emotional exhaustion and organizational pride are formed by job demands and job resources and how gender and organizational tenure moderate the model. Design/methodology/approach - The paper surveyed 252 call center agents and tested the research hypotheses with component-based structural equation modeling. Two multi-group analyses clarify the proposed moderating effects of gender and organizational tenure. Findings - Emotional exhaustion and organizational pride essentially determine turnover intentions. Organizational pride, which has received little attention in related research, plays a central role. Two job demands and three job resources strongly influence emotional exhaustion and organizational pride, respectively. Gender and organizational tenure moderate several effects. Research limitations/implications - This study is based on a sample of call center agents from three different call centers in one country. Therefore, the generalizability of the findings has to be tested. Furthermore, the paper examines turnover intentions, which are good predictors of turnover behavior. Nevertheless, further research should investigate the relationship between the variables and actual turnover. Moreover, the model included six different job determinants. Future research should test the proposed model with other job demands and resources. Practical implications - Emotional exhaustion and organizational pride substantially affect turnover intentions. Call center managers should protect employees from emotional exhaustion and enhance organizational pride, using specific job demands and resources. This study shows how the importance of certain variables differs for various groups of employees. Originality/value - This study is the first to examine how certain job resource foster organizational pride and how organizational pride affects voluntary employee turnover in call centers. Further, the study demonstrates that the socio-demographic variables gender and organizational tenure moderate the creation of emotional exhaustion and organizational pride, which together explain a large amount of the variance in turnover intentions among call center agents."

This paper offers an alternative modelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied Mark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to plausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of economic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence of regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous shocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a production/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain shock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions about monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various explanations for the resurgence of inflation in the United States, including demand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are four-fold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take years to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; {(ii) the success of monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring, rather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii) however, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and unemployment, leading to a narrow window of ``optimal'' policy responses due to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment;} (iv) the two most sensitive model parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of our study have implications for Central Bank decision-making, and offers an easy-to-use tool that may help anticipate the consequences of different monetary and fiscal policies."

Field experiments with asymmetric commons dilemmas have shown that groups who are able to derive high social efficiency also had higher equity compared to groups who were not able to derive significant levels of social efficiency. These findings resemble the high productivity in long-lasting irrigation systems based on self-governance. We present an agent-based model based on cultural group selection that shows that the patterns observed in the field experiments can be evolved in cases where agents participate regularly in less challenging symmetric public good dilemmas. These results indicate that cooperation in asymmetric dilemmas can evolve and persist when the agents contend with other social dilemmas than the asymmetric dilemmas.
MillerKentD2010DTiD,,Different Truths in Different Worlds,"Miller, Kent D and Lin, Shu-Jou",2010,"Organization science (Providence, R.I.)",21,1,97-114,,,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"Models of organizational learning typically assume that organizations rely upon performance feedback and that an exogenous (uncontrollable) environment presents the problems that organizations seek to solve. By contrast, we consider how different epistemologies within organizations, or combinations of epistemologies, and the degree to which the environment is amenable to organizational control jointly affect learning over time. This study presents three different epistemologies expressed in interpersonal learning: pragmatism (learning beliefs from better performers), coherentism (learning beliefs that fit together), and conformism (adopting beliefs that are popular). We also examine the learning implications of a dominant coalition that can promulgate its preferred beliefs throughout an organization. Outcomes from our agent-based model point toward key epistemological and environmental contingencies affecting the dynamics of organizational learning. Organizations filled with pragmatists learn effectively if the environment is fixed or controllable. Coherentists and conformists advance in knowledge only to the extent that they can control the environment. Adding pragmatists to organizations with coherentists or conformists produces a nonlinear (S-shaped) effect on knowledge achieved as different proportions of pragmatists alter social networks. Models involving learning from a dominant coalition affirm March's trade-off between learning speed and eventual knowledge achieved only for organizations filled with pragmatists and operating in an uncontrollable environment."

This study develops an agent-based model of endogenous grievances that builds on the new constructivist conceptualization of ethnicity and the theories of group inequality and crosscuttingness. Specifically, I simulate conflict as a function of spontaneous economic disparities between nominal ""ethnic groups"" with no predefined salient categories and related antagonism. Then I apply the model to reconsider the effect of (bidimensional) ethnic structure on conflict, which has been largely dismissed in recent scholarship. By varying the parameters of ethnic demography in artificial societies, I conduct a series of replicable experiments revealing that various structural settings yield systematically different patterns of conflict. While there is no ""most hazardous"" structure per se, both polarization and crosscuttingness appear to decrease the likelihood of violence but increase its potential deadliness, which indicates a more general tradeoff of conflict incidence and intensity."
MillerKentD2016Olwf,,Organizational learning with forgetting: Reconsidering the exploration–exploitation tradeoff,"Miller, Kent D and Martignoni, Dirk",2016,Strategic organization,14,1,53-72,,,SAGE,"London, England","Prior exploration–exploitation models of organizational learning generally neglect forgetting. This study models organizational learning with forgetting and derives some novel implications. Most noteworthy, our findings point out limits to the contention that promoting rapid learning undermines long-run knowledge. Slower learning is not always better. When agents are subject to forgetting, raising the rate of interpersonal learning often enhances the diversity of beliefs within an organization, as well as the number and range of aspects of the environment that organizational members come to know. The rate of learning that maximizes organizational knowledge or diversity varies with the rate of forgetting. Organizations need not sacrifice diversity as they gain knowledge. Analyses of our model indicate that knowledge and diversity are positively correlated across organizations. Implications of forgetting redirect theorists, empirical researchers, and managers toward alternatives to some conclusions from prior exploration–exploitation modeling studies."

The study of production–living–ecological space (PLES) is essential for the sustainable use of land resources and regional socioeconomic development, and several studies have adopted PLES-based evaluation indices. However, few studies have investigated the effects of governmental regulation and human activity on the optimal allocation of land for different uses. Crucially, the non-optimal use of land by urban decision-makers leads to multiple problems including wasting potential land resources and trade-offs between economic development and environmental protection. Therefore, in this study, we developed a multi-spatial agent-based optimisation model (MSABOM) coupled with a multi-agent system (MAS) within a machine-learning framework. The MSABOM determines spatially optimised land-use solutions based on the small-scale land-use preferences of stakeholders, and addresses conflicts in the sub-optimal allocation of resources based on the behaviours of model agents and the decision-making environment. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China was used as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The results show that (1) the MSABOM can significantly improve the optimisation of PLES, improving the land utilisation rate by 1.22 times; (2) based on an understanding of existing practices, the optimal allocation plan obtained by the agent-based model is more suitable than that obtained by a non-agent-based model; (3) multi-functional land-use patterns can be optimally allocated in space and time, which is extremely useful for coordinating stakeholder participation and addressing conflicts of interest in land-use behaviours; and (4) an urban spatial development coefficient was successfully used to determine the dominant function and functional positioning of PLES, which helps ensure flexible development strategies for spatial planning."

The open-access, open-assessment e-journal",14,2020-9,27-Jan,,,Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW),Kiel,"As suggested by recent empirical evidence, one of the causes behind the widespread rise of inequality experienced by OECD countries in the last few decades may have been the increased flexibility of labor markets. The authors explore this hypothesis through the analysis of a stock-flow consistent agent-based macroeconomic model able to reproduce with good statistical precision several empirical regularities. They employ three different sensitivity analysis techniques, which indicate that increasing job contract duration (i.e. decreasing flexibility) has the effect of reducing income and wealth inequality. However, the authors also find that this effect is diminished by tight monetary policy and low credit supply. The last result suggests that the final outcome of structural reforms aimed at changing labor flexibility can depend on the macroeconomic environment in which these are implemented."
HsiehPei-Hsun2023FtFC,,"Freedom to Freeride? Collective Action, Coercive Policies, and Social Trust","Hsieh, Pei-Hsun",2023,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Many societal challenges, such as responses to pandemics, climate change, and misinformation, are social dilemmas in which short-term self-interests conflict with long-term collective interests. Coercive government-imposed interventions can serve as a powerful tool to overcome free-riding in large-scale social dilemmas. However, coercive policies are sometimes criticized for restricting individual freedom. Moreover, in a highly polarized society, coercive policies may undermine social trust and increase political polarization. In three chapters, I examine people’s behavior toward coercion using an economic game, textual data from social media, and agent-based modeling. I use an economic game to test whether people value others’ freedom of choice in social dilemmas. In the study, subjects can pay a fee to activate one of two institutional settings. In one setting, a participant would be matched with a voluntary cooperator if they cooperated; in the other setting, both players are required to cooperate. In the second chapter, I use machine learning for text analysis to examine people’s reactions to mandatory policies when they are coerced. Psychological reactance theory suggests that when individuals experience a threat to their freedom, they become angry and motivated to regain their freedom. Individuals who experience reactance will engage in restricted action and other aggressive behaviors, such as derogating the source of the threat. To test whether vaccine mandates induce psychological reactance, I collected 5.83 million vaccine-related tweets between July 2021 and February 2022 and used machine learning to automate the process of distinguishing tweets specifically about vaccine mandates from all other vaccine-related tweets. The final chapter uses agent-based modeling to explore the origins of preferences for coercive cooperation policies. In a small society, cooperation can be maintained by information about each other’s reputations. The cost of information increases disproportionately as society grows. In the absence of reputation information, a third party, usually the government, is necessary to facilitate cooperation. On the other hand, members’ preferences may become more heterogeneous as society grows. The third chapter examines how the tradeoff affects support for coercive policies with different parameters in the models, including generalized trust and heterogeneity in society."

C. M. and van de Laar, Mart A. F. J. and Severens, Johan L.",2014,PharmacoEconomics,32,10,1015-1028,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,"Background Management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by a sequence of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological response modifiers (BRMs). In most of the Western countries, the drug sequences are determined based on disease activity and treatment history of the patients. A model for realistic patient outcomes should reflect the treatment pathways relevant for patients with specific characteristics. Objective This study aimed at developing a model that could simulate long-term patient outcomes and cost effectiveness of treatment strategies with and without inclusion of BRMs following a clinical guideline for treatment decisions. Methods Discrete event simulation taking into account patient characteristics and treatment history was used for model development. Treatment effect on disease activity, costs, health utilities and times to events were estimated using Dutch observational studies. Long-term progression of physical functioning was quantified using a linear mixed-effects model. Costs and health utilities were estimated using two-part models. The treatment strategy recommended by the Dutch Society for Rheumatology where both DMARDs and BRMs were available (Strategy 2) was compared with the treatment strategy without BRMs (Strategy 1). Ten thousand theoretical patients were tracked individually until death. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 1,000 sets of parameters sampled from appropriate probability distributions. Results The simulated changes over time in disease activity and physical functioning were plausible. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of Strategy 2 compared with Strategy 1 was €124,011. At a willingness-to-pay threshold higher than €119,167, Strategy 2 dominated Strategy 1 in terms of cost effectiveness but the probability that the Strategy 2 is cost effective never exceeded 0.87. Conclusions It is possible to model the outcomes of complex treatment strategies based on a clinical guideline for the management of RA. Following the Dutch guideline and using real-life data, inclusion of BRMs in the treatment strategy for RA appeared to be less favourable in our model than in most of the existing models that compared drug sequences independent of patient characteristics and used data from randomised controlled clinical trials. Despite complexity and demand for extensive data, our modelling approach can help to identify the knowledge gaps in clinical guidelines for RA management and priorities for future research."

Our theoretical approach considers bounded rationality of agents (consumers and producers), heterogeneity of both agents and product characteristics, and the co-evolution of consumer desires, mainly, by social emulation. The proposed dynamics can reproduce some stylized facts that are well known in literature, such as the S-shaped adoption rate curve that many industries develop over their life cycle. Our model also obtains a novel result with relevant theoretical implications: the strictness of requirements, a factor rarely studied in consumer theory, has an important effect on some aggregate variables that are usually explained by the supply side, such as the number of producers or the industrial concentration index. In particular, the minimum number of producers (and then, the maximum Herfindahl index) is obtained for an intermediate degree of consumer requirements, a fact that is empirically validated for the wine market in Spain."

This study compares the performance of a groundwater market with water quotas when assumptions of perfect information are violated due to climate change and hydrogeologic heterogeneity and explores how changes in future climate affect market performance. A subbasin of the Republican River Basin, overlying the Ogallala aquifer in the High Plains of the United States, is used as a case study. Building on a previously developed model, a multiagent system model simulating a groundwater market is developed where self-interested agents can trade water use permits to maximize individual benefits subject to irrigation and land constraints. This economic model is coupled with a calibrated physically based groundwater model for the study region that allows for an evaluation of streamflow depletion impacts, which has been the focus of management efforts in the basin. Results show that trading of permits between farmers results in increased economic benefits and, in some cases, reduced environmental violations. However, the benefits of a groundwater market are distributed unequally resulting in ""winners"" and ""losers"" across the system. Future changes in climate are shown to significantly influence farmers willingness to pay for groundwater and thus increase the variation in groundwater price and pumping. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing hydroclimatologic variability and change in the design of groundwater markets. Abstract Copyright (2019), American Geophysical Union.

Due to high density during transit, the potential risk of disease transmission is high, and the government has taken a wait and see approach to resume normal operations. To reduce disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. - forming groups of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ( ) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ( ) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ( ) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and or economic & social activity."

They show that such behaviors can become widespread under a broad range of conditions and can support very high levels of cooperation, even in one-move prisoner's dilemma games. When cooperation is especially costly to individuals, the authors show how ethnocentrism itself can be necessary to sustain cooperation."

Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on an agent-based model and the applied methodology is the computational simulation. Findings The policymaker can actively reduce the instability of financial market by means of policies aimed to increase the heterogeneity of investors, both in terms of the behavioral attitude for market participation and of the differentiation of opinions; favor investors who show insensibility with regard to market information; limit the allowed number of counterparts for any market order; reduce the time validity of orders; and maintain flexibility and efficient bargaining, reduce transaction costs and avoid Tobin taxes. Research limitations/implications In future research, an opinion dynamics engine within a clustered community network will be embedded. Practical implications Indeed, the obtained results are policy rules which could be immediately applied. Originality/value The order book model contained in the paper is completely new, innovative and original. Innovativeness is based on a reduced number of simplifying assumptions. The realism of the presented mechanism is higher than in other existing models. The value of the model is high because of several factors. From the scientific point of view, it constitutes the reliable framework on which many other papers will be based: it is the core center of future research. From the policymaker’s point of view, it represents a credible tool for policy hypotheses testing."

The model predicts that groups of noise traders are busy communicating when market uncertainty is high. In particular, we examine the effects of social interactions on price movements, based on parameter estimation of the group behavior. As traders’ reactions to new information act much like an endogenous shock on return volatility, however, we cannot easily find an exact solution for the model with social interactions. Thus, simulation-based inference is used for the model validation; we investigate whether our artificial economy can match the empirical moments observed in five major foreign exchange data sets (as closely as possible). The results indicate that the return volatility under scrutiny can be robustly decomposed into news (45–55 %) and social interaction effects (45–55 %)."

DemaryMarkus2011Ttga,,"Transaction taxes, greed and risk aversion in an agent-based financial market model","Demary, Markus",2011,Journal of economic interaction and coordination,6,1,28-Jan,,,Springer-Verlag,Berlin/Heidelberg,"Recent agent-based financial market models came to the result that taxing financial transactions does not per se increase financial stability and that the response of volatility and misalignments to rising tax rates seem to be u -shaped. Moreover, greed and the risk appetite of traders are often blamed for financial instability and there is no evidence how greed and risk aversion affect the effectiveness of regulations in financial markets. We aim to add to this gap in the literature by analyzing how the effectiveness of transaction taxes depend on different behavioral patterns within an agent-based framework. Our simulations indicate that a tax rate of 0.1% demarcates the stabilizing tax regime from the destabilizing one. We figure out that transaction taxes are less effective, either when chartists trade more aggressively, fundamentalists trade less aggressively, agents switch more frequently between trading strategies or only have short memory in their fitness measures. Lower risk aversion of agents, however, makes higher tax rates more effective as indicated by a flatter volatility response curve. We conclude that additional regulations should concentrate on the traders’ responsibilities for their risk-exposure."

In this paper, we study whether, and to what extent, the topology of the trade network can explain the rate of COVID-19 diffusion and mortality across countries. We compute the countries’ centrality measures and we apply the community detection methodology based on communicability distance. We then use these measures as focal regressors in a negative binomial regression framework. In doing so, we also compare the effects of different measures of centrality. Our results show that the numbers of infections and fatalities are larger in countries with a higher centrality in the global trade network."

Perspectives from Multi-Agent Based Experiments,"He, Ling-Yun",2010,Computational economics,36,3,263-282,,,Springer US,Boston,"Empirical findings point out that the scaling and multiscaling properties can be found in many dealer markets. But how do these properties emerge from these financial markets? What are the dynamical causes for these nonlinear properties? Are they the results of random perturbations, or of the intrinsic characteristics of the markets? To answer these questions, first of all, I proposed a minimally structured agent-based model of a dealer market, and then conducted many experiments under several scenarios. This artificial financial market is occupied with heterogeneous agents characterized with bounded rationality and heterogeneity, and a dealer who is responsible for market liquidity and supply-demand balance. By means of simulations based on different scenarios, trading time series (prices, volumes, volatilities, etc) are generated and then are analyzed by Multi-Fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA). Interestingly, the generated price series display scaling and multiscaling features, which is consistent with empirical findings in the real markets. Furthermore, the plausible explanation for these properties is nonlinear temporal correlation instead of probability distribution after the series are shuffled and phase randomized. All of the results imply that these properties of nonlinearity may derive from market participants’ heterogeneity and mutual interactions; thereby, they may be the underlying characteristics of dealer markets."

The study formed a model of the customs influence on the enterprise economic security system based on the use of the game theory. For two participants of the game – customs and enterprise – the indicators that determine the strategy of the participant in the game and its behavior in such a game are proposed. It has been empirically proven that the customs does not use the optimal strategy when interacting with business entities, causing a negative impact both on individual subjects and on the results of customs activities.

The authors address the issue using three types of computational experiments, including a global sensitivity analysis carried out through a novel methodology which greatly reduces the computational burden of simulations. The result emerges that a more restrictive monetary policy increases inequality, even though this effect may differ across groups of households. In addition, it appears to be attenuated if the bank's willingness to lend is lower. The overall analysis suggests that inequality can constitute valuable information also for central banks."

How disruptive this transition will be to the economy and societal well-being is unknown, particularly if there are any sudden resource supply constraints. However, the effects of resource supply constraints on an economy, or models of the interdependent relationship between the economy and natural capital overall have not been thoroughly developed. One problem is that traditional models of the economy assume linear growth, while highly interdependent industrialized economies may behave more like a complex adaptive system with non-linear, path-dependent, and unexpected growth trajectories. Agent-based models have been shown to successfully model important aspects of a complex adaptive economy. This paper uses an agent-based model to demonstrate potential economic impacts for industrialized economies in the face of a sudden resource supply constraint. Economic “agents” mine resources and invent technology. Through trade and specialization, the economy evolves from a collection of self-sustaining, resource-poor agents to a society with a high degree of interdependence and wealth. Economic growth, however, comes with a cost; the interdependence that arises from specialization and trade also leads to a less resilient economy. Unexpected, large economic collapse can arise from a shock to even a single resource, due to each resource’s interdependent role in the economy."

Rational choice models may be less appropriate as behavioral models when modeling decisions in complex environments in which decision makers may simplify the decision problem using heuristics. Pedestrian behavior in shopping streets is an example. We therefore propose a modeling framework for pedestrian shopping behavior incorporating principles of bounded rationality. We extend three classical heuristic rules (conjunctive, disjunctive and lexicographic rule) by introducing threshold heterogeneity. The proposed models are implemented using data on pedestrian behavior in Wang Fujing Street, the city center of Beijing, China. The models are estimated and compared with multinomial logit models and mixed logit models. Results show that the heuristic models are the best for all the decisions that are modeled. Validation tests are carried out through multi-agent simulation by comparing simulated spatio-temporal agent behavior with the observed pedestrian behavior. The predictions of heuristic models are slightly better than those of the multinomial logit models."

Despite the various and different domains in which recommender agents are used and the variety of approaches they use to represent user interests and make recommendations, there is some functionality that is common to all of them, such as user model management and recommendation of interesting items. This paper aims at generalizing these common behaviors into a framework that enables developers to reuse recommender agents' main characteristics in their own developments.Design methodology approach - This work presents a framework for recommendation that provides the control structures, the data structures and a set of algorithms and metrics for different recommendation methods. The proposed framework acts as the base design for recommender agents or applications that want to add the already modeled and implemented capabilities to their own functionality. In contrast with other proposals, this framework is designed to enable the integration of diverse user models, such as demographic, content-based and item-based. In addition to the different implementations provided for these components, new algorithms and user model representations can be easily added to the proposed approach. Thus, personal agents originally designed to assist a single user can reuse the behavior implemented in the framework to expand their recommendation strategies.Findings - The paper describes three different recommender agents built by materializing the proposed framework: a movie recommender agent, a tourism recommender agent, and a web page recommender agent. Each agent uses a different recommendation approach. PersonalSearcher, an agent originally designed to suggest interesting web pages to a user, was extended to collaboratively assist a group of users using content-based algorithms. MovieRecommender recommends interesting movies using an item-based approach and Traveller suggests holiday packages using demographic user models. Findings encountered during the development of these agents and their empirical evaluation are described here.Originality value - The advantages of the proposed framework are twofold. On the one hand, the functionality provided by the framework enables the development of recommender agents without the need for implementing its whole set of capabilities from scratch. The main processes and data structures of recommender agents are already implemented. On the other hand, already existing agents can be enhanced by incorporating the functionality provided by the recommendation framework in order to act collaboratively."

We first estimate demand functions for P&G and competitor brands from the period before value pricing was initiated. We then formulate a dynamic manufacturer-retailer Stackelberg model that includes P&G, a national-brand competitor, and a retailer. The model takes P&G's move as given and prescribes the price and promotion response of the competitors and the retailer. We substitute the estimated demand parameters into the model to obtain prescriptions for each competitor and the retailer, and see whether these prescriptions are related to the actual response. We find that the dynamic game-theoretic model calibrated with empirical estimates of demand parameters has significant predictive power. We also test the predictive power of two benchmark models. The first is based on the reaction function approach of Leeflang and Wittink (Leeflang, Peter S. H., Wittink, Dick R. 1992. Diagnosing competitive reactions using (aggregated) scanner data. Internat. J. Res. Marketing 9 3957.), and the second is a simplification of our dynamic model where the retailer is not strategic. The dynamic game-theoretic model performs better than either benchmark."

We propose an evolutionary model of the diffusion process, focusing on the characteristics of economic agents and on the interactions among them, and relate those determinants with the observed shape of the diffusion curve. Using simulation techniques, we show that the proposed model is able to explain why an innovation may not diffuse globally across an economy/region, even when it faces no rival innovations. Moreover, we show how network size, informational spillovers, and the behavior of innovation prices shape the diffusion process. The results regarding network size and informational spillovers rationalize the importance of informational lock-outs, proving they can influence both the aggregate adoption rate and the speed of the diffusion process. With respect to innovation prices, simulation results show that faster price decline leads to higher aggregate adoption rates, and that the diffusion process is more sensitive to the pricing dynamics than to the network size or the behavior of spillovers."

Trading in stock markets involves potential risk because the price is affected by various uncertain events ranging from political influences to economic constraints. Models that trade using predictions may not always be profitable mainly due to the influence of various unknown factors in predicting the future stock price. Trend Following is a trading idea in which, trading decisions, like buying and selling, are taken purely according to the observed market trend. A stock trend can be up, down, or sideways. Trend Following does not predict the stock price but follows the reversals in the trend direction. A trend reversal can be used to trigger a buy or a sell of a certain stock. In this research paper, we describe a deep Q‐Reinforcement Learning agent able to learn the Trend Following trading by getting rewarded for its trading decisions. Our results are based on experiments performed on the actual stock market data of the American and the Indian stock markets. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms forecasting‐based methods in terms of profitability. We also limit risk by confirming trading actions with the trend before actual trading."

It shows that a single market process unleashed by the decline of unionization can account for both the macro- and micro-economic phenomena, and that deunionization can be modeled as an endogenous outcome of competition between high wage firms seeking to raise productive capacity and low productivity firms seeking to cut wages. The model highlights the antipodal competitive dynamics between a ""winner-takes-all economy"" in which corporate strategies focused on cost reductions lead to divergence in productivity and wages and a ""social market economy"" in which competition rewards the accumulation of firm-level capabilities and worker skills with a more egalitarian wage structure."

Such validation is difficult, perhaps because of their complexity; moreover, simulations can prove existence, but not in general necessity. The paper highlights the Energy Modeling Forum's benchmarking studies as an exemplar for simulators. A market of competing coffee brands is used to discuss the purposes and practices of simulation, including explanation. The paper discusses measures of complexity, and derives the functional complexity of an implementation of Schelling's segregation model. Finally, the paper discusses how courts might be convinced to trust simulation results, especially in merger policy. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"
PowellJH2005Isai,,Identifying strategic action in highly politicized contexts using agent-based qualitative system dynamics,"Powell, J H and Coyle, R G",2005,The Journal of the Operational Research Society,56,7,787-798,,,Taylor & Francis,ABINGDON,"In the early phases of using system dynamics models to support strategic decision-making, the emphasis is on expressing information and physical flows. These aspects appropriately dominate those managed systems that can be thought of as being mechanistic. We suggest, however, that such an emphasis, to the exclusion of equally important system attributes such as power, leverage, influence and control, is inappropriate for a large class of problems involving agents and groups of agents in the system definition. Such politicized systems are ubiquitous, particularly in the strategic context, and in managing them it is necessary to take the political aspects of power into account at an early stage in the analysis. We present an approach to this class of problems, using a qualitative procedure based on influence diagrams. This method has been extensively and successfully used in consultancy to study the motivations and powers of agents and thereby produces naturally an output directed at action planning at the strategic level. While it is complementary to numerical system dynamics approaches, it is more successful in deriving components of strategic action directly from analysis."
EccaSabrina2008MaSo,,Modeling and Simulation of an Artificial Stock Option Market,"Ecca, Sabrina and Marchesi, Michele and Setzu, Alessio",2008,Computational economics,32,2-Jan,37-53,,,Springer US,Boston,"Since their introduction in 1973, options have become an important and very popular financial instrument. However, despite much research performed on the subject, the effects of option trading on the underlying asset market are still debated. Both empirical and theoretical studies have failed to point out how price volatility and volumes of the underlying asset are affected. In this paper we present the first study on the effects of an option market related to an underlying stock market, using an artificial financial market based on heterogeneous agents. We modeled a realistic European option using two market models. The microstructure of the first model is kept as simple as possible, being composed only of random traders. The second model is more complex and realistic, involving the presence of various kinds of trading strategies (random, fundamentalist and chartist). We show that the introduction of options, in the proposed models, tends to decrease the volatility of the underlying stock price. Moreover, the traders’ wealth can be strongly affected by the use of option hedging."

In an attempt to understand part of the complexity of land use change we here aim to explore the ways in which economists deals with the land use issue. we argue that space is one of the forgotten items in economics. Economists often seem to ignore high-resolution spatial dynamics either because they are not considered as an important feature of the problem or out of habit. It seems as though there is a trade-off between spatial resolution and human behaviour in current applications. Certain types of models are capable of capturing the spatial complexity of urban and regional areas, for instance, by using cellular automata. Other types of land use models clearly have shortcomings where it concerns spatial detail. Dynamic modelling approaches do not guarantee a high spatial resolution. We propose to give more attention to agent based modelling as this type of modelling provides aspecific connection between processes on micro level and macro-level spatial structures."

However, especially for tankers, the implementation of this concept is almost non-existent. Still, these vessels have a relatively high port energy use, despite relatively short port visits, as they provide power to both pumps and inert gas systems during unloading and loading. A key factor in the reluctance, besides the fact that a sparkless connection is required, is the lack of a standard and the uncertainty from both tanker owners visiting a berth and terminal owners on which shore power systems to apply. This paper investigates the interdependency between ship and terminal owner choices for systems and establishes the overall most economical solution. Cold ironing was reviewed to identify existing systems and solutions and analyse the tanker fleet and terminals. The insights were combined in an integrated economic model consisting of two sub-models; one relating terminal decisions to a cold ironing price and one establishing the vessel side costs and savings. By using fuel price as an input and acceptance rates (for both terminals and vessels) for cold ironing systems as key variables to determine. The models have been used to identify the potential of cold ironing for shortsea and parcel tankers against different fuel prices and % of fleet and terminals that have shore power equipment. In all cases, shore power was not economical, which was caused by the high costs of the fixed costs of electricity, due to the high powers required. Interesting avenues for further research would be to increase the individuality of the model using e.g. an agent based model. Also extending the model with a battery pack on the terminal to allow for peak-shaving could lead to much lower costs and higher economic potential."

This relation is analysed via qualitative simulation modelling using a simple agent-based model. We define an economic system in which firms compete on the quality characteristics of a certain complex good, in a market where consumers have shown preferences for them. Firms are conceived as bounded rational agents that explore complex product technologies in order to improve their fitness in relation to the selection environment (i.e. the consumers' evaluation of the characteristics of the final good). The architecture of the good produced in the system is characterised by different degrees of modularity (i.e. the lower the correlations between the contributions of the different product components to the fnal product fitness, the simpler the good's technology and the higher the degree of modularity). On the other hand, the impact of product modularity on industrial dynamics is analysed using a set of quite homogeneous firms. First, the model yields highly differentiated dynamics for firms that start from similar initial conditions, pointing to the importance of their research strategies. Second, the dynamic patterns obtained show that firms may easily end up in technological lock-in in spite of initial good performance, suggesting that path-dependence could be broken. Third, modularity impinges directly upon market results: a decrease in modularity, by increasing the difficulty in searching the complex technology, selects a limited number of firms, thus determining concentration in market shares. Finally, the industrial dynamics are influenced by the evolution of the quality of the fnal good."

Although these influences are widely accepted, previous models on the diffusion of new technologies and products have either reduced these multiple dimensions of uncertainties to only one parameter, or have completely neglected them altogether. Both might lead to a pro-innovation bias. Therefore we present an agent-based approach that takes several different innovation resistances in a multi-generation environment into account. Hydrogen vehicles and the necessity of setting up a corresponding infrastructure were chosen for a sample application as they incorporate a band of various dimensions of innovation resistance. Examples are the uncertain infrastructure situation, the uncertainty arising from new and improved features, the uncertainty about the technologies’ real ecological benefit, the unknown maintenance cycles and costs, or the ambiguous technical parameters such as vehicle range. These various uncertainties are even more distinctive if multiple technology generations are considered. Our results indicate that a short-term decrease in the adoption rate can be observed although the technological parameters of a later product generation might be more beneficial for the consumers. As we show, this effect can be eased through timing variation of the communication measures. Therefore we conclude that considering multiple innovation resistance factors in innovation diffusion might reduce the pro-innovation bias."

Workers cast their vote on labor market regulation depending on the past payoffs that they accrued when one of two competing parties with different labor market policy platforms was in power. We identify important interactions with exogenous shocks. In more turbulent economic times, employment protection systems can affect labor market performance for some periods even after the shock has subsided."

First, agency theory serves as the basis for a model that predicts the use of monitoring mechanisms and incentive compensation. Then, it is argued that these mechanisms are insufficient for managing subsidiaries characterized by high levels of intra-firm international interdependence, the management of which is critical to many of today's complex global firms. A second set of hypotheses is argued, linking international interdependence to several social control mechanisms. Primary and secondary data from U.S. based multinational corporations were used to test both sets of hypotheses. The results indicate that agency theory, although a useful foundation for studies of control within MNCs, is limited in its ability to explain fully the phenomenon of foreign subsidiary control, however, the model based on intra-firm interdependence had much greater predictive ability."
AtallahShadyS2012AAMo,,An Agent-Based Model of Plant Disease Diffusion and Control: Grapevine Leafroll Disease,"Atallah, Shady S and Gomez, Miguel I and Conrad, Jon M and Nyrop, Jan P",2012,,,,,,,,,"The grapevine leafroll disease (GLRD) threatens grape harvests in the United States and the world. This viral disease reduces yield, delays fruit ripening, and affects wine quality. The disease ecology is still under study and the spatial-dynamics of the spread process remains poorly understood. Moreover, little is known about cost-efficient strategies to control the disease. In an effort to address this gap in the literature, we model GLRD diffusion in a vineyard and evaluate bioeconomic outcomes under alternative disease control strategies. We employ agent-based modeling (ABM) tools and contribute to bioeconomic literature on agricultural disease control in several ways. First, our model relaxes the assumption of agent homogeneity and allows instead agents to be heterogeneous in age and infection states, thus in their economic values. Second, we make the model inherently spatial-dynamic by combining the ABM with a cellular automaton system. Third, we incorporate realism when modeling the spread process by making the disease onset and its transmission stochastic. That is, initial infections follow a random spatial distribution and stochastic agent interaction gives rise to Markov process-type disease diffusion. Finally, we formulate novel control strategies consisting of roguing and replacing infected grapevines based on their age and infection states. We evaluate these strategies and identify those that perform best at extending the expected vineyard half-life and at maximizing the vineyard expected net present values relative to the baseline of no control. The model results underscore the ecological and economic tradeoffs implied by disease control strategies based on age and infection states."

Part D, Transport and environment",80,,102231-,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"•Proposed a model to site charging stations (CS) for electric vehicles (EV).•Evaluated three EV adoption pathways with shared mobility and autonomous vehicles.•Considered increasing EV adoption, queuing at CS, and flexible charging rules.•No significant reduction in service level observed with increasing EV adoption.•EV adoption in SAVs reduces CO2 emissions from taxis by 85% daily. The transportation sector is undergoing three revolutions: shared mobility, autonomous driving, and electrification. When planning the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, it is critical to consider the potential interactions and synergies among these three emerging systems. This study proposes a framework to optimize charging infrastructure development for increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in systems with different levels of autonomous vehicle adoption and ride sharing participation. The proposed model also accounts for the pre-existing charging infrastructure, vehicle queuing at the charging stations, and the trade-offs between building new charging stations and expanding existing ones with more charging ports. Using New York City (NYC) taxis as a case study, we evaluated the optimum charging station configurations for three EV adoption pathways. The pathways include EV adoption in a 1) traditional fleet (non-autonomous vehicles without ride sharing), 2) future fleet (fully autonomous vehicles with ride sharing), and 3) switch-over from traditional to future fleet. Our results show that, EV adoption in a traditional fleet requires charging infrastructure with fewer stations that each has more charging ports, compared to the future fleet which benefits from having more scattered charging stations. Charging will only reduce the service level by 2% for a future fleet with 100% EV adoption. EV adoption can reduce CO2 emissions of NYC taxis by up to 861 Tones/day for the future fleet and 1100 Tones/day for the traditional fleet."

Blockchain based local energy markets (LEMs) have been introduced in recent years as a way to enable local consumers/prosumers to trade their energy locally in a distributed and highly secured manner in an LEM. However, there are still some challenges regarding the main factors that can drive local consumers/prosumers to participate in a blockchain based LEM, optimal community size and prosumer to consumer ratio for an efficient LEM. Also, there is still no information on how the quantifying factors for participation on a blockchain based LEM can affect the performance of an LEM. This paper presents a survey and simulation based analysis of quantifying factors for participation in a blockchain based LEM. The survey was distributed among local consumers/prosumers and a total of 261 responses were received from the responders. The results from the responders were analyzed using a Python code based statistical analysis model. The simulation based analysis was conducted using a community based LEM model and evaluated using data received from a combination of German household profiles and standard load profiles. The survey results showed that the major drive for local consumers/prosumers to participate on blockchain based LEM is their willingness to support renewable energy integration, transparency and trust offered by a blockchain network. On the other hand, the simulation based analysis showed that small and medium communities with prosumers to consumer ratios between 0.3 to 0.5 create more economic and technical benefits for local consumers/prosumers compared to large communities. The community based simulation results were modelled together with the survey results to determine how the individual quantifying factors for participating in a blockchain based LEM can affect the performance of an LEM."

By zooming in , we refer to the unit of analysis, which is a single consumer (instead of segments or markets) and the use of granular sales data (daily) instead of smoothed (e.g., annual) data as is more commonly used in the literature. By analyzing the high volatility of daily data, we show how changes in sales patterns can self-emerge as a direct consequence of the stochastic nature of the process. Our contention is that the fluctuations observed in more granular data are not noise, but rather consist of accurate measurement and contain valuable information. By stepping into the noise-like data and treating it as information, we generated better short-term predictions even at very early stages of the penetration process. Using a Kalman-Filter-based tracker, we demonstrate how movements can be traced and how predictions can be significantly improved. We propose that for such tasks, daily data with high volatility offer more insights than do smoothed annual data."

In this regard, the study illustrates BC's products and services rendered to customers, forms of delivery channels and BC's view on banking services and Kiosk-based BC programs.Design/methodology/approachThe current paper is an empirical study based on surveying 200 Kiosk-based BCs working in the state of Kerala. After the preliminary screening analysis of the data with outlier deletion, removal of missing values and normality test, both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were executed followed by reliability test, convergent and discriminant validity tests. Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CBSEM) was performed for CFA and inferential tests were carried out by using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) and analysis of a moment structures (AMOS) and Eviews.FindingsChiefly, eight operational forms of BCs were found from the field survey. Hypothetical tests show the significant impact of the serviceability of banks on BC's profitability. Validity tests such as average variance extracted (AVE), composite reliability (CR), maximum shared variance (MSV) and average shared variance (ASV) were established after the removal of the cross-loaded items of the questionnaire from the rotated component matrix. BCs perform main banking services especially bank account opening facility and Akshaya E-Centers are widely used for this model as Kiosk banking in the surveyed state.Originality/valueSo far, no study has encompassed empirical research on performance analysis and outreach of the BC model in the state of Kerala where this BC model well functions. Since the study is a novel form of banking channelization for FI, the study can contribute to understanding the further feasibility and future dimension of the model based on experimental views of BCs."

We think of de-centralization as wages being a weighted average of an economy-wide ‘union wage’ and a firm-specific component depending on the firm’s productivity and the experienced tightness of the labor market. Starting from a baseline scenario, corresponding to a high degree of unionization, in which wages are fully centralized and indexed on economy-wide productivity gains and inflation, we investigate how an increasing level of de-centralization affects the dynamics of output, employment, inequality, and market concentration. Our findings suggest that stronger centralization of the wage-setting process induces lower wage inequality and stronger concentration on the consumption goods market. Furthermore, due to more physical investments, an economy with more centralized wage setting is characterized by higher productivity and faster economic growth."

The purpose of this study is to develop an analytical solution to the N -person prisoner’s dilemma game when boundedly rational agents interact in a population. Previous studies in the literature consider the case in which cooperators and defectors have the same learning factors. We obtain an analytical equation to find equilibria in the N -person prisoner’s dilemma game in the general case when agents have different learning factors. We also introduce a more realistic approach where probability values are bounded between zero and one and therefore eliminates the possibility of infeasible probability values. Since no analytic solution can be derived in this case, agent based simulation is used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the resulted dynamical system."
TrinkoDavidA2023MaSt,,Modeling and Simulation to Investigate the Electrification Potential of Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicle Fleets,"Trinko, David A",2023,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This project involves developing and integrating new modeling tools to simulate the dynamics of electric medium- and heavy-duty fleet vehicle adoption. A technical and economic modeling tool, combining a data-driven hardware cost model with a cost-optimal charging strategy microsimulation, enables tailored analysis of the costs and benefits of electrifying individual fleets. Next, a novel text synthesis process, applied to a curated corpus of literature, quantifies trade-offs between technical, economic, and other factors in the fleet vehicle procurement decision. The outcomes of these tasks combine with knowledge from recent literature on fleet decision processes to specify the vehicle procurement model used by fleets in an agent-based model of the medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicle market. This model embodies an especially disaggregated approach to adoption modeling, internalizing factors and dynamics that conventional adoption models externalize. In particular, explicitly modeling the formation and diffusion of opinions among agents enables experiments that conventional models cannot support. Demonstrations show, for example, that increasing the extent of interactions between populations with different proclivities to electric vehicles has an asymmetrical outcome. High-proclivity electric vehicle adoption is generally unaffected as interactions increase, but low-proclivity adoption is accelerated. By representing individual fleets’ requirements and costs at a high level of detail, incorporating an adoption decision model informed by a wide body of empirical research, and broadening the array of variables and dynamics available for experimentation, this integrated model offers a new way to understand the urgent challenge of eliminating emissions from the most emissions-intensive transportation sectors."

Throughout the three stages of the evolution of world modelling, the development of computer technology has had a definitive role, hence this study regards computer technology as a framework of world modelling. The first evolutionary stage is related to the spread of IBM computers at the beginning of the 1970s, its milestone being the model published in The Limits to Growth (Meadows et al. 1972). With the spread of desktop computers in the second stage, world models that could run on PCs appeared; the first one being MicroIFs (International Futures) in the second part of the 1980s. The third wave was generated by the proliferation of the Internet and the continuing acceleration of the processing speed of computers. Models have become downloadable, virtually simultaneous processing options enable multi-agent-based simulations. As a result of these, models can be extended with the analyses of dynamic and emergent phenomena. Recent methodological concepts and trends promise new theoretical synthesis of world modelling."

Climate change and trade liberalization have opened new ways of pest invasions. Given the consumer preference towards organic agricultural products and environment-friendly nature of natural pest control strategies, biological control is considered to be one of the potential options for managing invasive insect pests. Drosophila suzukii (Drosophilidae) is an extremely damaging fruit pest, demanding development of effective and sustainable biological control strategies. In this study, we assessed the potential of the parasitoid Leptopilina japonica (Figitidae) as a biocontrol agent for D. suzukii using ecological niche modeling approaches. We developed global -scale models for both pest and parasitoid to identify four components necessary to derive a niche based, target oriented prioritization approach to plan biological control programs for D. suzukii: (i) potential distribution of pest D. suzukii, (ii) potential distribution of parasitoid L. japonica, (iii) the degree of overlap in potential distributions of pest and parasitoid, and (iv) biocontrol potential of this system for each country. Overlapping suitable areas of pest and parasitoid were identified at two different thresholds and at the most desirable threshold (E = 5%), potential for L. japonica mediated biocontrol management existed in 125 countries covering 1.87 x 107 km2, and at the maximum permitted threshold (E = 10%), land coverage was reduced to 1.44 x 107 km2 in 121 countries. Fly pest distributional information as a predictor variable was not found to be improving parasitoid model performance, and globally, only in half of the countries, >50% biocontrol coverage was estimated. We therefore suggest that niche specificities of both pest and parasitoid must be included in site -specific release planning of L. japonica for effective biocontrol management aimed at D. suzukii. This study can be extended to design cost-effective pre-assessment strategies for implementing any biological control management program."

By design, the information of trade records is difficult to tamper. Therefore, it can deal with the trust problem without a central operator. Blockchain technology has brought about major reform in the financial field and has been paid more and more attention in many fields. The combination of blockchain technology and energy trade seems to have good prospects due to their common features of distribution, diversity and marketization. In this paper, a new decentralized energy trading framework based on blockchain technology is presented and analyzed. In this framework, four basic participators in the market are set, which are the consumer, supplier, speculator (with energy storage capacity) and regulator. In addition, the order format and price clearing mechanisms are designed accordingly. The new framework can accommodate a large number of entities and enable them to achieve better economic benefits. Small examples are used to analyze the framework. It is concluded that this technology has significant under-researched potential to support and enhance the efficiency gains of the energy revolution, and areas for future research are identified."

A model is analysed in which boundedly rational agents trade with and gather information from their neighbours within a trade network. It is demonstrated that a trader’s ability to profit and to identify the equilibrium price is positively correlated with its degree of connectivity within the market. Where traders differ in their number of potential trading partners, well-connected traders are found to benefit from aggressive trading behaviour. Where information propagation is constrained by the topology of the trade network, connectedness affects the nature of the strategies employed."

First, the complex adaptive economic system, as defined in John Foster (2005), is compared with the view of a system that is embodied in standard economic theory. Second, this difference is illustrated through an examination of the role of the familiar production function construct in economics. The economy is a complex adaptive system and by necessity, must be treated as such by economists. Economic wisdom involves a capacity to see which particular aspects of a complex system are crucial in any particular epoch and to provide a straightforward analytical framework in which they can be handled. This has to be done in a way that is not so general as to become valueless and not so theoretical that it loses connection with historical experience."

Benefits of delaying therapy include avoiding the negative side effects and toxicities associated with the drugs, delaying selective pressures that induce the development of resistant strains of the virus, and preserving a limited number of treatment options. On the other hand, the risks of delayed therapy include the possibility of irreversible damage to the immune system, development of AIDS-related complications, and death. We use Markov decision processes to develop the first HIV optimization models that aim to maximize the expected lifetime or quality-adjusted lifetime of a patient. We prove conditions that establish structural properties of the optimal solution and compare them to our data and results. Model solutions, based on clinical data, support a strategy of treating HIV earlier in its course as opposed to recent trends toward treating it later."

Trades are driven by an agent-based model where individual agents observe the trading decisions of previous agents, as well as their private signal on the value of the asset and then execute a trading decision. Given trading decisions of agents, how can a market observer detect a shock to the underlying value of the traded asset? The distribution of shock times is assumed to be phase-type distributed to allow for a general set of change time probabilities beyond geometric change times. We show that this problem is equivalent to change detection with social learning. We provide structural results that allow the optimal detection policy to be characterized by a single threshold policy."

Why, for instance, do employee bonuses sometimes lead to decreases in productivity? Why do some products generate tremendous buzz seemingly out of nowhere, while others languish despite multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns? How could a simple clerical error snowball into a catastrophic loss that bankrupts a financial institution? Traditional approaches like spreadsheet and regression analyses have failed to explain such ""emergent phenomena,"" says Eric Bonabeau, because they work from the top down, trying to apply global equations and frameworks to a particular situation. But the behavior of emergent phenomena, contends Bonabeau, is formed from the bottom up-starting with the local interactions of individuals who alter their actions in response to other participants. Together, the myriad interactions result in a group behavior that can easily elude any top-down analysis. But now, thanks to ""agent-based modeling,"" some companies are finding ways to analyze - and even predict - emergent phenomena. Macy's, for instance, has used the technology to investigate better ways to design its department stores. Hewlett-Packard has run agent-based simulations to anticipate how changes in its hiring strategy would affect its corporate culture. And Societe Generale has used the technology to determine the operational risk of its asset management group. This article discusses emergent phenomena in detail and explains why they have become more prevalent in recent years. In addition to providing real-world examples of companies that have improved their business practices through agent-based modeling, Bonabeau also examines the future of this technology and points to several fields that may be revolutionized by its use."

The purpose of this paper is to propose and implement a strategy, via a simulation tool, for the sharing of parking places between light cars and vans for goods delivery.Design methodology approach - Temporal and spatial dynamic booking of on-street parking places is described by using the multi-agent paradigm. Main agents concerned by the sharing of parking places, their rules and interactions are implemented. Behavioral models and learning process of cognitive agents based on stated preferences collected beside the network users are designed for capturing multi-agent interactions.Findings - By coupling a 2D traffic simulation tool and the Copert III methodology, it is possible to simulate the traffic and environmental consequences of several scenarios for different infrastructures, occupancy rate of the places reserved for goods delivery and durations of the delivery process.Research limitations implications - Several points are under development: a 3D environment will capture with more realism the behavior of agents in a larger spatial scale and in real time. The behavioral models will be designed by stated preferences obtained from surveys containing questions coupled with pictures of possible scenarios.Practical implications - Applied in a real context, the sharing of parking places strategy shows benefits for traffic and for the environment. A decision maker can use this strategy for simulating scenarios, in the context of an urban area in particular.Originality value - The paper demonstrates how a simulation tool based on strategy of parking place sharing can satisfy constraints of transportation network users."

Through an in-depth case study, it illustrates clearly the antecedents of exaptation processes, which are particularly relevant in rapidly changing environments requiring new solutions under time and resource constraints.Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopt a single case study approach that is particularly suitable in case of an inductive research design, which is required because of the novelty of the topic. The research is inspired by the use of the snorkeling mask EASYBREATH, commercialized by the giant Decathlon, as a medical device, a respirator to treat patients affected by coronavirus in Italy. The authors organized the evidence according to a novel taxonomy grounded in the literature.FindingsThe case study stimulates reflections on the existence of some antecedents to the exaptive innovation process in constraint-based environments: (1) the availability of specific actors in the innovation process; (2) the creation of platforms of interaction between people with different competences, nurtured by collective bottom-up financing systems; (3) the role of the community of makers, in particular, and of the 4th industrial revolution, in general, for creating enabling technologies; (4) multidisciplinary individual background of key actors in the innovation process is crucial to ensure the exaptive path to be in place.Research limitations/implicationsThis work has some limitations, due to the choice of limiting the analysis to a single case, nevertheless, it offers a first glance on a new technological trajectory available in constraint-based environments.Originality/valueThe case study results underline the importance of new digital collaboration platforms as knowledge multipliers, and illuminate on the potential of the fourth manufacturing revolution, which, through new technologies, creates opportunities for distributed forms of innovation that cross long distances."

This model fits within the neo-institutional conceptual framework; more specifically, we used the DiMaggio/Powell analytical grid. Our desire to prepare this model was born from the observation that the analytical framework that is generally used to study the adoption of these new standards is the neo-institutional framework and that the principal methodologies implemented are qualitative. The question addressed in this study regards the forces leading an agent—in this case, an organisation providing standards for accounting—to adopt, at a given moment, these new standards. Existing studies, as interesting as they might be, are devoted to the question of adoption and leave aside the question of diffusion. In other words, the evolution of the system as a whole in time is ignored. Constructing a model appeared to us to be a way to move beyond these limitations. This model allows us to formalise the forces at work in the DiMaggio/Powell representation and to simulate the diffusion processes of the IFRS. To this end, we implement a multi-agent simulation. The various simulation scenarios are then compared to the observed diffusion of the IFRS."

An agent based artificial market is developed to determine the impact of the interaction between investors on prices. It consists of sentiment investors, a single fundamental investor and a market maker. Sentiment investors live in a small world network and have limited liquidity. They trade based on their assessment of the future direction of the market. Consistent with the social learning literature, there are two types of sentiment investors; social learners and experts. Experts only consider private information while social learners also consider the views of neighbours. It is found that the interaction between the agents generate kurtosis and persistence characteristics of volatility in returns. In addition, the level of kurtosis and volatility depends on the inter-connectedness of the network as well as the number of experts and the number of connections from these experts to social learners. Cluster coefficient and characteristic path length analysis show that kurtosis and volatility are lowest within the small world region of the network. This effect is negated as the number of experts increases beyond a threshold."

In the model, overconfident individuals overreact to their information about future inflation, which causes greater overshooting in the forward rate than in the spot rate. Thus, when agents observe a signal of higher future inflation, the consequent rise in the forward premium predicts a subsequent downward correction of the spot rate. The model can explain the magnitude of the forward premium bias and several other stylized facts related to the joint behaviour of forward and spot exchange rates. Our approach is also consistent with the availability of profitable carry trade strategies."

This study aims to develop a model that explores the determinants of independent manufacturers’ representatives’ (i.e. IMRs’) intentions to comply with their principals’ requests for additional tasking. Using agency theory, the authors explore the application of behavior and outcome-based controls upon dyadic manufacturer-IMR relationships for these additional performance/task requests. Design/methodology/approach Data from over 1,000 US-based IMRs were used to test two constructs; inter-organizational climate and perceptions of mutual satisfaction within the agency-principal dyad. Compliance behaviors tested were IMRs’ intentions to engage in non-selling-related tasks and intentions to allocate additional selling time to principals’ products. The following four exogenous controls were tested: perceived goal congruence between IMRs and principals; IMRs’ perceptions of principals’ expertise; mutual communications between IMRs and principals in the supply chain dyad; resources and sales support programs provided by principals to IMRs; and IMRs’ perceptions of the adequacy and fairness of the principals’ compensation plans. Findings Two constructs – inter-organizational climate and perceptions of mutual satisfaction with the agency-principal dyad – mediated the effects of exogenous sales controls on two compliance behaviors. The model’s data were analyzed using Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). A marker variable was deployed to check for common method variance also supported using the Partial least squares (PLS) factor solution. Most variables demonstrated significant direct and mediated effects on each compliance behavior. Variables that emphasized behavioral-based controls dominated intentions for IMRs to engage in non-selling tasks. The principal commission structure, the only sales outcome-based control in the study, most influenced IMRs’ intentions to commit additional sales time to their principals’ products. Research limitations/implications This study only examined the intentions of IMRs to engage in additional selling activities and their intention to engage in non-selling tasks. Principals may desire longer-term commitments from IMRs. The model developed here can be modified to capture additional behavioral and attitudinal outcomes including, for example, the exit intentions of IMRs. Practical implications Principals are well-advised to foster a positive inter-organizational climate that fuels perceptions of mutually satisfying working relationships with their IMRs. These mutually satisfying working relationships can, by themselves, positively influence IMRs to acquiesce to reasonable requests made by principals. This advice appears to be particularly crucial when asking IMRs to engage in additional non-selling tasks. The total pattern of path estimates points to the conclusion that capable sales control plays an important role in fostering positive inter-organizational climates. The inter-organizational climate – mutual satisfaction link proved crucial as a mediator of the impact of sales controls on IMRs’ behavioral compliance intentions. Originality/value Knowing the impact of sales controls on IMR’s affords businesses the ability to use these controls for behavioral compliance intentions on non-selling tasks."

We examine economies where agents herd on others, yet they have limited sets of information on other agents to imitate. In particular, we conduct experiments on economies with agents with different levels of information sharing where agents can imitate: (1) the strategies of others but with an error, (2) the strategies of only a fraction of agents, or (3) the strategies of others, but update their parameters only by a proportion. In each experiment we change the likelihood that agents make errors to copy the strategy of others, the fraction of agents to herd, or the proportion of the parameter that agents update, in order to examine the effect of the different degrees of information sharing on volatility clustering. We show that volatility clustering tends to disappear when agents have limited information on the strategies of others, and agents need to imitate the strategy details of others in order to generate the clustered volatility."

The design of a model and the data inputted into it are central factors in ensuring credible inferences. We executed a narrative review of a set of dynamic HIV transmission models to comprehensively synthesize and compare the structural design and the quality of evidence used to support each model. We included 19 models representing both generalized and concentrated epidemics, classified as compartmental, agent-based, individual-based microsimulation or hybrid in our review. We focused on four structural components (population construction; model entry, exit and HIV care engagement; HIV disease progression; and the force of HIV infection), and two analytical components (model calibration/validation; and health economic evaluation, including uncertainty analysis). While the models we reviewed focused on a variety of individual interventions and their combinations, their structural designs were relatively homogenous across three of the four focal components, with key structural elements influenced by model type and epidemiological context. In contrast, model entry, exit and HIV care engagement tended to differ most across models, with some health system interactions—particularly HIV testing—not modeled explicitly in many contexts. The quality of data used in the models and the transparency with which the data was presented differed substantially across model components. Representative and high-quality data on health service delivery were most commonly not accessed or were unavailable. The structure of an HIV model should ideally fit its epidemiological context and be able to capture all efficacious treatment and prevention services relevant to a robust combination implementation strategy. Developing standardized guidelines on evidence syntheses for health economic evaluation would improve transparency and help prioritize data collection to reduce decision uncertainty."

We construct an agent-based network model of an artificial financial system allowing us to analyze the effects of state support on systemic stability and the feedback loops of risk transfer back into the financial system. The model is tested with various parameter settings in Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses yield the following key results: first, in the short term, all the support measures improve systemic stability. Second, in the longer run, there are settings which mitigate the systemic crisis and settings which contribute to systemic breakdown. Finally, there are differences among the effects of the different types of support measures. While bailouts and recapitalization are the most efficient types of support type and execution of guarantees is still a viable solution, the results of liquidity measures such as asset relief or provision of funding liquidity are significantly worse."

In particular, it is established that an increase in the average degree of product diversification in an industry increases the incentive for a producer to reduce the time to market for innovations at the expense of product quality. However, if all firms adapt their strategies according to these incentives, this results in a severe loss of average firm profits in the industry and also to a reduction in consumer surplus. It is then studied how the strength of this dilemma depends on several parameters describing the market structure and patent policy."

How peasant households allocate their human capital to maximize the utility of a household unit was investigated on the basis of the unitary principle under the assumption of risk aversion. The roles of living expenses, subsidies and income adjustment factors were also considered. Our results revealed the paradoxical phenomenon that rural surplus labor and the Lewis turning point coexist."

Preference heterogeneity regarding status competition is modeled by asymmetric consumption externality parameters whereas heterogeneity regarding voluntary simplicity is incorporated by allowing for agent-specific restrictions on maximum consumption. Equilibrium is studied in terms of a balanced growth path (BGP). Numerical examples suggest that degrowth triggered by voluntary simplicity by a subset of consumers less affected by status competition has a positive effect on the aggregate welfare under externalities in consumption and leisure. A reduction in status competition increases the aggregate welfare and reduces the equilibrium growth rate. Simulations suggest that a time-varying equilibrium in the heterogeneous preference model with two consumer classes is well approximated by a constant BGP. •The paper studies degrowth and growth in a dynamic equilibrium model with preference heterogeneity.•Preferences are heterogeneous with respect to status competition and voluntary simplicity.•A weakening of status consumption increases equilibrium welfare and reduces growth.•Simulations suggest that degrowth triggered by voluntary simplicity increases equilibrium welfare under externalities in consumption and leisure.•Equilibrium with two consumer classes is well-approximated by a constant balanced growth path."
LemppFrieder2017Asia,,A software implementation and case study application of Lempp’s propositional model of conflict resolution,"Lempp, Frieder",2017,The International journal of conflict management,28,5,563-591,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose The starting point of this paper is the propositional model of conflict resolution which was presented and critically discussed in Lempp (2016). Based on this model, a software implementation, called ProCON, is introduced and applied to three scenarios. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate how ProCON can be used by negotiators and to evaluate ProCON’s practical usefulness as an automated negotiation support system. Design/methodology/approach The propositional model is implemented as a computer program. The implementation consists of an input module to enter data about a negotiation situation, an output module to generate outputs (e.g. a list of all incompatible goal pairs or a graph displaying the compatibility relations between goals) and a queries module to run queries on particular aspects of a negotiation situation. Findings The author demonstrates how ProCON can be used to capture a simple two-party, non-iterative prisoner’s dilemma, applies ProCON to a contract negotiation between a supplier and a purchaser of goods, and uses it to model the negotiations between the Iranian and six Western governments over Iran’s nuclear enrichment and stockpiling capacities. Research limitations/implications A limitation of the current version of ProCON arises from the fact that the computational complexity of the underlying algorithm is EXPTIME (i.e. the computing time required to process information in ProCON grows exponentially with respect to the number of issues fed into the program). This means that computing time can be quite long for even relatively small negotiation scenarios. Practical implications The three case studies demonstrate how ProCON can provide support for negotiators in a wide range of multi-party, multi-issue negotiations. In particular, ProCON can be used to visualise the compatibility relations between parties’ goals, generate possible outcomes and solutions and evaluate solutions regarding the extent to which they satisfy the parties’ goals. Originality/value In contrast to standard game-theoretic models of negotiation, ProCON does not require users to provide data about their preferences across their goals. Consequently, it can operate in situations where no information about the parties’ goal preferences is available. Compared to game-theoretical models, ProCON represents a more general approach of looking at possible outcomes in the context of negotiations."

We combine evolutionary game theory and spatial agent‐based simulation approaches with input–output analysis to evaluate two different sectors: (i) crop and animal production; (ii) financial service activities. We separate the European Union in manifold regions and consider the following factors in the decision making: (i) market potential; (ii) productive integration; (iii) labour costs and (iv) displacement cost. Firms assign weights to each of these factors. Our results suggest that in traditional sectors firms tend to seek unsaturated markets. In sectors related to services, the greater the uncertainty, the greater the likelihood that firms will move. Resumen Este artículo tiene por objeto analizar las decisiones de localización de las empresas como respuesta a Brexit. En el artículo se combina la teoría de juegos evolutivos y los enfoques de simulación espaciales basados en agentes con el análisis de input–output, con el fin de evaluar dos sectores diferentes: i) la producción de cultivos y animales; y ii) las actividades de los servicios financieros. Se desagregó la Unión Europea en múltiples regiones y se consideraron los siguientes factores en la toma de decisiones: i) el potencial de mercado; ii) la integración productiva; iii) los costos de la mano de obra y iv) el costo del desplazamiento. Las empresas asignan un valor ponderado a cada uno de estos factores. Los resultados sugieren que en los sectores tradicionales las empresas tienden a buscar mercados no saturados.

GeJiaqi2020Pitp,,Points in the pareto front in model validation; validation result in trade partners; validation result in trade volume; simulated vs actual trade partners; simulated vs actual trade volumes from Food and nutrition security under global trade: a relation-driven agent-based global trade model,"Ge, Jiaqi and J. Gareth Polhill and Macdiarmid, Jennie I. and Fitton, Nuala and Smith, Pete and Clark, Heather and Dawson, Terry and Aphale, Mukta",2020,,,,,,,The Royal Society,,"This paper addresses the highly relevant and timely issues of global trade and food security by developing an empirically grounded, relation-driven agent-based global trade model. Contrary to most price-driven trade models in the literature, the relation-driven agent-based global trade model focuses on the role of relational factors such as trust, familiarity, trade history and conflicts in countries' trade behaviour. Moreover, the global trade model is linked to a comprehensive nutrition formula to investigate the impact of trade on food and nutrition security, including macro and micronutrients. Preliminary results show that global trade improves the food and nutrition security of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Trade also promotes a healthier and more balanced diet, as countries have access to an increased variety of food. The effect of trade in enhancing nutrition security, with an adequate supply of macro and micronutrients, is universal across nutrients and countries. As researchers call for a holistic and multifactorial approach to food security and climate change (Friis et al. 2016 Journal of Land Use Science 11, 131–153. (doi:10.1080/1747423X.2015.1096423); Hammond and Dubé 2012 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 109, 12 356–12 363. (doi:10.1073/pnas.0913003109)), the paper is one of the first to develop an integrated framework that consists of socio-economic, geopolitical, nutrition, environmental and agri-food systems to tackle these global challenges. Given the ongoing events of Brexit, the US-China trade war and the global COVID-19 pandemic, the paper will provide valuable insights on the role of trade in improving the food and nutrition security across countries."
AsanumaDaiki2013Laaa,,Lending attitude as a financial accelerator in a credit network economy,"Asanuma, Daiki",2013,Journal of economic interaction and coordination,8,2,231-247,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"In existing literature, commercial banks are often considered mere financial intermediaries that facilitate the flow of credit in an imperfect credit market. However, as demonstrated in the history of financial instability, the behavior of financial institutions plays an important role. This paper examines how lenders’ attitudes affect macroeconomic performance. In our analysis, the economy is composed of multiple borrowers (firms) and one lender (bank). Each borrower is directly connected to the lender through its credit contract. At the same time, each borrower is indirectly connected to all the other borrowers within the credit network. Using this model, we execute computer simulations to examine the economic consequences of lending attitudes. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the bank’s lending attitude functions as a financial accelerator; that is, it significantly affects the dynamics of the economic system through the credit network. Consequently, the same level of exogenous shock generates completely different outcomes depending on the different lending attitudes. The results also show that there exists an optimal lending attitude that leads to high economic growth and a stable growth path."

Objectives : To forecast the impact of the use of darunavir with low-dose ritonavir 600/100 mg twice a day (bid) in highly treatment-experienced, HIVinfected adults who have failed one or more protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen on the budget of the French Sickness Fund (French healthcare system) over a 3-year time horizon. Methods : A transition state model based on disease severity was developed that compared the evolution of antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral-related direct costs of care in the target population over 3 years (2007–2009) under two scenarios: (1) darunavir enters the French market in year 1; (2) darunavir is not available to the target population during 2007–2009. Model inputs were derived from a targeted analysis of the French hospital database in HIV, the darunavir POWER 1 and 2 trials and other relevant clinical studies. Results : In the scenario where darunavir was available from year 1, the proportion of patients in the lower, more costly CD4 cell count strata (≤100 cells per mm 3 ) was consistently lower than in the scenario without darunavir in each year of the model (17.0% vs 19.2%, 13.9% vs 18.3% and 10.8% vs 16.8% for years 1, 2 and 3, respectively). As a result, over the entire 3-year period, the net increase of antiretroviral drug costs (+5.6 million Euros; €), resulting from the substitution of older, cheaper PIs by darunavir, is expected to be fully compensated by savings in hospitalization costs (€-9.7 million) and expenditures for otherHIV-related (non-antiretroviral)medications (€-7.3million), leading to a net saving of €11.4 million or 2.9% of the total budget in the scenario without darunavir. Various sensitivity analyses confirmed these projected savings. Conclusion : The use of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 600/100mg bid, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, in highly pre-treated, HIV-infected adults who have failed one or more PI-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen is not expected to increase the budget of the French healthcare system, in comparison with a scenario without darunavir. Further research is needed to estimate the budget impact of the use of DRV/r in less treatment-experienced, HIV-infected individuals in France."

We propose an ""Adaptive Personalization System"" and illustrate its implementation for digital audio players, a product category with rapidly expanding sales. The proposed system automatically downloads personalized playlists of MP3 songs into a consumer's mobile digital audio device and requires little proactive user effort (i.e., no explicit indication of preferences or ratings for songs). The system works in real time and is scalable to the massive data typically encountered in personalization applications. A simulation study shows the Adaptive Personalization System to outperform benchmark approaches. We implemented the Adaptive Personalization System on Palm PDAs and tested its performance with digital audio users. For actual users, the Adaptive Personalization System provides substantial improvements over benchmark approaches both in terms of the number of songs listened to and listening duration."

However, the hypotheses themselves are sometimes criticized. Market impacts, where trades of investors can impact and change market prices, making optimization impossible. In this study, we built an artificial market model by adding technical analysis strategy agents searching one optimized parameter to a whole simulation run to the prior model and investigated whether investors' inability to accurately estimate market impacts in their optimizations leads to optimization instability. In our results, the parameter of investment strategy never converged to a specific value but continued to change. This means that even if all other traders are fixed, only one investor will use backtesting to optimize his/her strategy, which leads to the time evolution of market prices becoming unstable. Optimization instability is one level higher than ""non-equilibrium of market prices."" Therefore, the time evolution of market prices produced by investment strategies having such unstable parameters is highly unlikely to be predicted and have stable laws written by equations. This nature makes us suspect that financial markets include the principle of natural uniformity and indicates the difficulty of building an equation model explaining the time evolution of prices."

In this vein, this paper aims to broaden the understanding of the process of technological change and standardization through an evolutionary approach, which avoids the determinism of conventional orthodox models of technology diffusion and standardization. The authors have used agent-based economic computational modeling to expand the understanding of technological competition in the presence of increasing returns to adoption by extending the modeling effort beyond the one-time, winner-takes-all approaches. It has shown that, over a long enough time horizon, an industry will see a succession of technological standards. Transitions between these standards can be fostered by the emergence of new technological alternatives that offer new sets of attributes."
AltmanMorris2005BEPR,,"Behavioral Economics, Power, Rational Inefficiencies, Fuzzy Sets, and Public Policy","Altman, Morris",2005,Journal of economic issues,39,3,683-706,,,Routledge,KNOXVILLE,"This paper builds upon the empirically based premise that neoclassical assumptions about the optimality and efficiency of economic agents in the sphere of production are wrong. The modeling of agency and firm explains why and how relatively high-wage firms and environments conducive to high-wage regimes can persist and prosper over historical time side by side with low-wage firms and environments, why and how inefficient firms can survive and prosper over historical time, and why there need not be, as there has not been, a convergence between low-wage and high-wage economies and institutional and related cultural variables within such differing economies are embodied. In behavioral model rational intelligent economic agents in a highly competitive economy need not to produce efficiently. Indeed, rational economic agent can choose to be inefficient if this serves their utility-maximizing ends. Economic agents have much more scope for choice -- greater degrees of freedom -- than they do in the conventional model of the firm. This wider spectrum of choice tends to conform to the stylized facts of economic life."

The first paper (Chapter 2) deals with quantifying consumer welfare from introduction of ride-hailing services represented by Uber taxi, the second paper (Chapter 3) is about dog vaccination design combining household-to-household visits with central point clinics by applying machine learning algorithm with economic theories, and the final paper (Chapter 4) handles agent-based simulation of the spread of infectious diseases due to livestock trading. Chapter 1 is an introduction to this dissertation. Chapters 2 and 3 have in common that both chapters employ a spatial modeling method and a structural estimation approach in empirical analysis. And Chapters 3 and 4 use simulation to test theoretical hypotheses through counter-factual scenarios. This dissertation applies a traditional econometric method of heterogeneous discrete choice model and a calibration method in Chapter 2 and includes non-traditional methods such as machine learning in Chapter 3 and agent-based modeling simulation in Chapter 4. Chapter 2 reveals that social welfare arising from Uber taxi originates from the unique characteristics of the ride-hailing service itself, not because the taxi price is inexpensive, so that regulations on the industry can adversely affect the welfare of consumers. Chapter 3 finds that combining direct household visits by a vaccination team and voluntary visits of households to central point clinics can save vaccination budgets rather than using only the household visit policy. The finding implies the combined policy can help eradicate dog rabies in rural African where the dog rabies still exists due to insufficient budget problems. Finally, Chapter 4 shows that even though infectious livestock can be used for trade, gains from trade as increased consumption is greater than total livestock losses due to the trade, which implies that policymakers who make livestock disease control policies need to consider other policy alternatives rather than making livestock trading prohibited."

Thus, a distributed, autonomous approach, strong enough to face changes is necessary, which is what MASs contribute to. An agent can represent each of the components that form the SC. Then the resulting agent system will own similar characteristics to the ones in the studied SC: autonomy, social abilities, reactivity, pro-activity.Findings - When analysing the demand for each SC member (from manufacturer to final consumer), one can observe that while consumer demand is a relatively stable feature, the upper link in the chain (the manufacturer), presents a very pronounced variability. This is known as the ""bullwhip effect"" or ""forrester effect"" and is mainly due to the fact that the SC members' strategies are not considered as a whole but as a sum of individual strategies. In the proposed system, each agent will be communicated with other ""agents"" who will be the only responsible for making forecasts based on information provided to it by all components of the chain. The ultimate goal is for each SC echelon to satisfy its own objectives, while at the same time meet the local and external constraints.Research limitations implications - In this work a standard SC is proposed (one manufacturer - one distributor - one wholesaler - one retailer) although it could easily be modified to incorporate a bigger number of members in each echelon within the SC.Originality value - The paper shows the benefits of using artificial intelligence in the SC management."

The estimation results show that in the real economy, in addition to rational agents, there are also boundedly rational agents with adaptive learning expectations. The impulse responses of macroeconomic variables to shocks are more sensitive and last longer than those from the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The ABNK model exhibits better out-of-sample forecast performance than both the vector auto-regression (VAR) and DSGE models."

For this purpose, we built a general equilibrium heterogeneous-agent model capable of exploring the relationship between fiscal policy variables and the endogenous cross-section distribution of income and wealth. Using a utilitarian welfare criterion, results show that different strategies yield different outcomes. Despite the positive welfare gains observed, transition costs affect all episodes and are determinant in sorting among the welfare-enhancing strategies. Our results confirm the superiority of adjustments partially based on the reduction of unproductive expenditures over those based on tax raises or on the reduction of social transfer. Welfare is further enhanced when consolidation strategies involve an equilibrated mix between expenditure and transfer cuts and tax increases, because debt consolidation processes mostly or exclusively based on social transfers cuts have a strong negative effect on welfare inequality. Moreover, shock volatility and persistency (also shaping inequality) help explain different results across countries: under high income inequality, consolidation processes are expected to yield smaller inequality effects on welfare, whereas a worse consumption–leisure trade-off may arise."

In this paper we introduce an alternative framework which describes the dynamic relationships between social segregation, workplace segregation, individuals’ homophily levels, and referral hiring. An agent-based simulation model was developed based on this framework. The model describes the process of continuous change in composition of workplaces and social networks of agents, and how this process affects levels of workplace segregation and the segregation of social networks of the agents (people). It is concluded that: (1) social segregation and workplace segregation may co-evolve even when hiring of workers occurs mainly through formal channels and the population is initially integrated (2) majority groups tend to be more homophilous than minority groups, and (3) referral hiring may be beneficial for minority groups when the population is highly segregated."

This research took the Jiangsu sulfur dioxide (SO₂) emissions trading program in China as a case study to examine the price dynamics over the next 10 years (2011–2020) based on Jiangsu’s new SO₂ emissions trading policy design. An adaptive agent-based simulation model was developed to estimate the price dynamics as well as the impact of energy price, policy design, and new environmental regulation on the permit price. The results showed that the equilibrium price of the Jiangsu SO₂ emissions trading market is approximately 4.20 CNY/kg, and the permit price will fluctuate around this price if the other conditions are not changed. If the coal price increases during 2011–2016, the permit price will decline to 2.79 CNY/kg by 2020 under China’s current coal–electricity price mechanism. In addition, the banking mechanism will smooth the price fluctuations and the average permit price will be generally higher when banking is not allowed. Finally, the stricter environmental regulation will reduce the market supply of permits and will raise the permit price. According to China’s potential new SO₂ discharge standard, the permit price will jump to 11 CNY/kg. The quantification of the permit price dynamics can help power plants to make decisions on emissions trading."
GongZhaoya2015Mmop,,"Multiscalar modeling of polycentric urban-regional systems: Economic agglomeration, scale dependency and agent interactions","Gong, Zhaoya",2015,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This dissertation aims to study the causal relationship between the underlying processes of agglomeration economies and the formation of certain spatial structures at both intra- and inter-urban scales within the extent of megaregions. First, on the theoretical side, I develop a general framework to account for the interplay between market linkages and spatial costs across scales. The model system constructed from this framework allows us to study the evolution of intra- and inter-urban spatial structures in terms of monocentricity/polycentricity and agglomeration/dispersion. By examining the impacts of local spatial costs and interregional trade costs on the structural change at both scales, I find the interdependency of spatial structures across urban-regional scales. Second, I extend the theoretical models into a 2-D geographic model that can scale to real world applications. This geographic model is based on zonal geography connected by transportation networks. An agent-based approach is employed to model the discrete choice for locations and to approximate the equilibrium conditions as those in theoretical models. The simulations confirm that it is consistent with the theoretical models regarding the generated spatial structures. A demonstration application to the Carolinas megaregion is presented as a test bed for the geographic model. Three simulation scenarios presented provide insights to understand the observed pattern of urban-regional developments. In addition, high-performance computing technologies are leveraged to improve the computational performance of the geographic model."

Hence, the purpose of this study the development and evaluation of ports play a key role in their commercial success. Development policies can be formulated for these ports by properly evaluating their performance indicators. On the other hand, traditional methods of performance evaluation cannot provide a good multidimensional evaluation of the status of ports. Design/methodology/approach More than 90% of the world’s heavy transit today is carried out by the sea. With this volume of freight, transit accidents are inevitable for ships passing through oceans, seas, waterways, rivers, ports and mooring at docks. Besides, gases from ships’ fuels at sea, especially in ports, oil spills due to maritime incidents, the negligence of the ship’s crew, the use of port equipment, dirty fuel of diesel power substations, etc., have increased greenhouse gases, polluted the environment and endangered human lives. Findings A new approach has been introduced in the field of port performance evaluation based on the components of greenness and intelligence. This approach performs evaluations in two stages and a network. In this study, the performance of 11 Iranian ports was evaluated based on the network data envelopment analysis approach in 2 stages of greenness and intelligence during 4 years. The results indicated that only 5% of the ports meet the standards of intelligence and greenness. Originality/value On the other hand, as shown in the above studies, the issue of green ports is directly related to the development of animal and plant ecosystems in the seas and the environment around ports. The presence of pollution in the ports has caused the animal and plant habitats around the ports to face a complete pollution crisis or to be completely destroyed. Therefore, the development of green port concepts in third world countries will help prevent environmental pollution of the seas. Therefore, it is necessary for ports to review their strategic maritime transport model and use the development of green port indicators in their implementation processes. Therefore, the strategic development of green ports is created to create and benefit from the components of intelligence, and as mentioned in previous research, intelligence and greenness are in line and the lack of development of one of the concepts causes defects in others. According to reports provided in Iran’s maritime transport systems, most accidents have led to environmental disasters during the absence of intelligent equipment. The use of smart technologies prevents all environmental damage and the development of port services. On the other hand, in evaluating the published articles in the field of development of green and smart ports, so far, the components of intelligence and greenness have not been evaluated and analyzed in a practical and operational way in ports and only the influencing the development of agents on each other has been done (Chen, 2019). Therefore, evaluating the efficiency of ports based on green components and intelligence causes ports to fundamentally review their executive infrastructure and take an active part in the global green development plan."

In this paper, using an agent-based simulation model in which artificial adaptive agents have mechanisms of decision making and learning based on neural networks and genetic algorithms, we compare the results of our simulation analysis with that of the mathematical model by Naylor. In particular, while Naylor’s model is based on rationality as it relates to individual utility maximization, agents behave adaptively in our agent-based simulation model; agents make decisions by trial and error, and they learn from experiences to make better decisions."
OrmerodPaul2009‘dit,,‘Binge’ drinking in the UK: a social network phenomenon,"Ormerod, Paul and Wiltshire, Greg",2009,Mind & society,8,2,135-152,,,Springer-Verlag,Berlin/Heidelberg,"In this paper, we analyse the recent rapid growth of ‘binge’ drinking in the UK. This means the rapid consumption of large amounts of alcohol, especially by young people, leading to serious anti-social and criminal behaviour in urban centres. British soccer fans have often exhibited this kind of behaviour abroad, but it has become widespread amongst young people within Britain itself. Vomiting, collapsing in the street, shouting and chanting loudly, intimidating passers-by and fighting are now regular night-time features of many British towns and cities. A particularly disturbing aspect is the huge rise in drunken and anti-social behaviour amongst young females. Increasingly, policy makers in the West are concerned about how not just to regulate but to alter social behaviour. Smoking and obesity are obvious examples, and in the UK ‘binge’ drinking has become a focus of acute policy concern. We show how a simple agent based model approach, combined with a limited amount of easily acquired information, can provide useful insights for policy makers in the context of behavioural regulation. We show that the hypothesis that the rise in binge drinking is a fashion-related phenomenon, with imitative behaviour spreading across social networks, is sufficient to account for the empirically observed patterns of binge drinking behaviour. The results show that a small world network, rather than a scale-free or random one, offers the best description of the data."

Part D, Transport and environment",116,,103617-,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"Current research on battery swapping stations (BSSs) deployment problems overlooks the influence of BSS layouts on the daily performance of battery swapping taxis (BSTs). This study aims to propose a BSS deployment optimization model to guarantee taxi transport capacity. To this end, the dynamic swapping demands of BSTs are predicted by modeling battery swapping behavior, reconstructing trip chain, and simulating BSS operation. Furthermore, BSSs’ deployment is optimized to minimize the swapping loss time. Using the daily trajectory data of 9862 taxis in Tianjin, we set up six scenarios to elucidate the trade-off among the layout and service level, the transport capacity, and the environmental efficiency. The optimal layout ensures 98.1% of the taxi transport capacity and reduces carbon emissions by 44.09%. The employed behavioral model enhances the network equilibrium from 0.33 to 0.067. Finally, the roles of driving range and charging speed in attracting and assigning energy demand are revealed."

Part B: methodological,102,,83-104,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"•Strictly dominant alternatives in stated choice experiments should be avoided as they can bias parameter estimates in logit models.•Strictly dominant alternatives can occur in all existing experimental design types.•Zero minimum regret is an indicator for the presence of a strictly dominant alternative.•Minimum regret can be used to adjust the scale parameter in a heteroscedastic logit model to account for dominance. Stated choice surveys have been used for several decades to estimate preferences of agents using choice models, and are widely applied in the transportation domain. Different types of experimental designs that underlie such surveys have been used in practice. In unlabelled experiments, where all alternatives are described by the same generic utility function, such designs may suffer from choice tasks containing a dominant alternative. Also in labelled experiments with alternative specific attributes and constants such dominance may occur, but to a lesser extent. We show that dominant alternatives are problematic because they affect scale and may bias parameter estimates. We propose a new measure based on minimum regret to calculate dominance and automatically detect such choice tasks in an experimental design or existing dataset. This measure is then used to define a new experimental design type that removes dominance and ensures the making of trade-offs between attributes. Finally, we propose a new regret-scaled multinomial logit model that takes the level of dominance within a choice task into account. Results using simulated and empirical data show that the presence of dominant alternatives can bias model estimates, but by making scale a function of a smooth approximation of normalised minimum regret we can properly account for scale differences without the need to remove choice tasks with dominant alternatives from the dataset."

The emergence and breakdown of trust is modeled in a context of multiple buyers and suppliers. Agents develop trust in a partner as a function of observed loyalty. They select partners on the basis of their trust in the partner and potential profit, with adaptive weights. On the basis of realized profits, they adapt the weight they attach to trust relative to profitability, and their own trustworthiness, modeled as a threshold of defection. Trust and loyalty turn out to be viable under fairly general conditions."

If decision making is influenced by confirmation bias, an agent puts more weight on positive information to confirm hypothesis or reservation in the learning process, which renders selectivity in information gathering. If the utility discovered post-purchase is low, it is externalised rather than internalised (i.e. self-blame) for the selectivity of information. This causes the agent to outweigh the negative information. These two mechanisms are simulated to investigate societal opinion dynamics and explain behavioural patterns such as over-confidence and convergence of opinions."
ChernomazKirill2014Alia,,Adaptive learning in an asymmetric auction: genetic algorithm approach,"Chernomaz, Kirill",2014,Journal of economic interaction and coordination,9,1,27-51,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"Agent-based simulations are performed to study adaptive learning in the context of asymmetric first-price auctions. Non-linearity of the Nash equilibrium strategies is used to investigate the effect of task complexity on adaptive learning by varying the degree of approximation the agents can handle. In addition, learning in different information environments is explored. Social learning allows agents to imitate each other’s bidding strategies based on their relative success. Under individual learning agents are limited to their own experience. We observe convergence to steady states near the predicted equilibrium in all cases. The ability to learn non-linear functions helps the agents with a non-linear equilibrium strategy but hurts the agents with an almost linear one. Better information about the opponent population has a relatively modest impact. A larger number of strategies to experiment with and an ability to systematically compare strategies by holding a number of factors constant have a comparatively stronger beneficial effect."

In today’s world, materialism is a crucial phenomenon of the modern age. According to social comparison theory, comparisons are a significant factor affecting the behavioral intentions of adolescents and young adults. Thus, this study develops a framework based on the stimulus–organism–response model and uses the framework to examine the impact of interpersonal communication and marketing factors on social comparison, materialism and compulsive buying, with social media acting as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach Using a survey method, data were collected in Study 1 from adolescents (n = 298) and in Study 2 from young adults (n = 345). Structural equation modeling analysis using partial least squares technique was used to analyze the data. Findings The results show that social comparison plays a significant role in developing materialistic values and compulsive buying among adolescents and young adults. Through these two studies, it was found that young adults are more socially comparative, materialistic and compulsive in buying as compared to adolescents. Moreover, social media use moderated the relationship between social comparison with peers and media celebrities, which means that rapid increase of social media use leads adolescents and young adults to create high social comparison and materialistic values. Research limitations/implications This research is based on the cross-sectional method, which limits the research findings. Practical implications This research helps corporate managers understand the interpersonal communication role in creating social comparison among individuals. The study found that peer communication plays a more important role in enhancing the social comparative values among young adults than among adolescents, which provides clear implications for the practitioner. Originality/value This study makes a significant contribution to extant literature by discussing the above issue and presenting quantitative data. The study extends the literature by examining and validating a theoretical model of how interpersonal communication among socializing agents affects social comparison among young adults and adolescents. This research examines outcomes of the social comparison with parents, peers and social media, based on the stimulus–organism–response (SOR) model."

This study was designed to more clearly elucidate the relationship between chemical factors (ingoing nitrite, ascorbate, and residual nitrite) and L. monocytogenes growth in RTE meats. Treatments of cooked, cured pork sausage (65% moisture, 1.8% salt, pH 6.6, and water activity 0.98) were based on response surface methodology with ingoing nitrite and ascorbate concentrations as the two main factors. Concentrations of nitrite and ascorbate, including star points, ranged from 0 to 352 and 0 to 643 ppm, respectively. At one of two time points after manufacturing (days 0 and 28), half of each treatment was surface inoculated to target 3 log CFU/g of a five-strain L. monocytogenes cocktail, vacuum packaged, and stored at 7 degrees C for up to 4 weeks. Growth of L. monocytogenes was measured twice per week, and enumerations were used to estimate lag time and growth rates for each treatment. Residual nitrite concentrations were measured on days 0, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28, and nitrite depletion rate was estimated by using first-order kinetics. The response surface methodology was used to model L. monocytogenes lag time and growth rate based on ingoing nitrite, ascorbate, and the residual nitrite remaining at the point of inoculation. Modeling results showed that lag time was impacted by residual nitrite concentration remaining at inoculation, as well as the squared term of ingoing nitrite, whereas growth rate was affected by ingoing nitrite concentration but not by the remaining residual nitrite at the point of inoculation. Residual nitrite depletion rate was dependent upon ingoing nitrite concentration and was only slightly affected by ascorbate concentration. This study confirmed that ingoing nitrite concentration influences L. monocytogenes growth in RTE products, yet residual nitrite concentration contributes to the antimicrobial impact of nitrite as well."
MillerEJ2005Atmo,,A tour-based model of travel mode choice,"Miller, EJ and Roorda, MJ and Carrasco, JA",2005,Transportation,32,4,399-422,,,Springer Nature,NEW YORK,"This paper presents a new tour-based mode choice model. The model is agent-based: both households and individuals are modelled within an object-oriented, microsimulation framework. The model is household-based in that inter-personal household constraints on vehicle usage are modelled, and the auto passenger mode is modelled as a joint decision between the driver and the passenger(s) to ride-share. Decisions are modelled using a random utility framework. Utility signals are used to communicate preferences among the agents and to make trade-offs among competing demands. Each person is assumed to choose the ""best'' combination of modes available to execute each tour, subject to auto availability constraints that are determined at the household level. The household's allocations of resources (i.e., cars to drivers and drivers to ride-sharing passengers) are based on maximizing overall household utility, subject to current household resource levels. The model is activity-based: it is designed for integration within a household-based activity scheduling microsimulator. The model is both chain-based and trip-based. It is trip-based in that the ultimate output of the model is a chosen, feasible travel mode for each trip in the simulation. These trip modes are, however, determined through a chain-based analysis. A key organizing principle in the model is that if a car is to be used on a tour, it must be used for the entire chain, since the car must be returned home at the end of the tour. No such constraint, however, exists with respect to other modes such as walk and transit. The paper presents the full conceptual model and estimation results for an initial empirical prototype. Because of the complex nature of the model decision structure, choice probabilities are simulated from direct generation of random utilities rather than through an analytical probability expression."

Recently this literature has expanded to include games in a setting where agents play only with local neighbors in a specified geography. In this paper we explore how the ability of agents to move and choose new locations and new neighbors influences the emergence of cooperation. First, we explore the dynamics of cooperation by investigating agent strategies that yield Markov transition probabilities. We show how different agent strategies yield different Markov chains which generate different asymptotic behaviors in regard to the attainment of cooperation. Second, we investigate how agent movement affects the attainment of cooperation in various networks using agent-based simulations. We show how network structure and density can affect cooperation with and without agent movement."

We introduce elements of increasing complexity (dynamic adjustment processes, nonlinear social interdependence, agents heterogeneity, agents local interaction) and we investigate their effects on the resulting social behaviors. The dynamics introduce the dependence of current preferences on past consumers actions. A non-monotone updating preference function allows us to obtain a threshold effect, according to which the agents adopt a bandwagon/snob behavior if the preferences are below/above a certain saturation level. We consider homogeneous and heterogeneous agents and we introduce local/global interaction when they are spatially distributed. We show through simulations several phenomena which are absent in the classical model and which reproduce significant social behaviors, such as path dependence, coexistence of different periodic and chaotic attractors, emergence of spatial patterns."

Despite all the sincere and coordinated efforts from all the humanitarian agents and bodies, the likely sustainable outputs are hampered by certain barriers (impediments) which exist at different levels of the HSCs. A better understanding of such barriers and their mutual relationship is deemed helpful in improving the outcomes of humanitarian efforts. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore, refine, establish and classify these barriers which thwart the sustainable efforts of the HSCs individually as well as collectively. Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature review is conducted to identify these barriers which were followed by soliciting the experts’ inputs to update, refine and retain the contextually relevant ones. The opinions about the nine identified and refined barriers are taken from eight experts based in the Northern India who are having at least five years of experience in humanitarian operations. Fuzzy interpretive structural modeling (FISM) is used to examine and establish a hierarchical relationship among these barriers, whereas fuzzy Matrice d’impacts croisés multiplication appliquée á un classment analysis is carried out to further classify these barriers into dependent, autonomous, linkage and dependent barriers. Findings The analysis led to the formation of a FISM model where the operational challenges affecting the performance occupy the topmost position in the hierarchy. The results reveal that inconsistent motives, coordination and communication and operational challenges affecting the performance are the dependent, poor strategic planning, capacity-related challenges and poor performance measurement system are the autonomous, and financial challenges, locational challenges and lack of proper awareness are the independent barriers. Research limitations/implications The focus of the researchers was to study and examine these barriers to sustainable HSCs with special reference to the epidemics and pandemics (especially COVID-19), and it sheds light particularly arising during and post disaster phases. Practical implications The structural model contributed by this study is expected to be meaningful for practitioners besides enriching the body of literature. In the context of pandemics, it distinguishes itself from the other available frameworks. Social implications As this research has been carried out in the context of the novel COVID-19, the framework is expected to assist policymakers in comprehending the issues impeding the sustainability of noble humanitarian efforts. Thus, ultimately it is expected to contribute to the ultimate cause of society at large. Originality/value This research endeavor distinguishes itself from the other accessible published resources in terms of the specific context, the methodological approach and the nature of respondents. This paper concludes with the practical implications and directions for future research."

Wade",2011,Journal of economic interaction and coordination,6,2,157-170,,,Springer-Verlag,Berlin/Heidelberg,"An agent-based model is used to determine market equilibrium with price-setting firms in an oligopoly market. The agent-based model is designed to match the experimental rules that Brandts and Guillen (J Ind Econ 55:453–474, 2007 ) used with human subjects. Their model uses posted prices and advance production of a perishable good. When the marginal cost is zero, the analytical Bertrand solution is almost perfect competition. When the marginal cost is nonzero, the game does not have a theoretical equilibrium in pure strategies. The agent-based model results show that with one or two firms, prices are at or near the monopoly level, which matches the human experiments. With four firms, prices are always at the perfectly competitive level when particle swarm optimization is used. Results using a genetic algorithm, however, are noisier than those using the particle swarm optimization, and the genetic algorithm falls short of the competitive solution. The triopoly market changes from mostly monopoly to a price in between monopoly and perfect competition when a marginal cost is added. The computerized agents tend to overproduce so that profits are negative in the three- and four-firm cases when production is costly. While the prices in the simulation are close to those observed in experiments with human subjects, the inefficiency due to overproduction is much greater in the agent-based model results. This result suggests that human agents are able to reach solutions, perhaps through social norms, that are missed by the simple agent-based rules used here."

Specifically, I examine whether the partial extension of trading hours—namely implementing the pre-market session and the after-hours session—and what duration of the session is effective. The simulation result reveals that the implementation of both sessions could have a negative impact on price efficiency and stability if investors’ participation during the session is limited; it could result in more concentrated trading in the opening session, wider divergence between market prices and the fundamental value, and lower price stability. In addition, longer sessions are less beneficial (or more harmful). My result also shows that there are very few benefits to trade during the extended-hours sessions. Thus, my findings suggest that the extended-hours trading has a structural weakness which causes illiquidity during the session and lowers price efficiency and price stability during the regular-hour session. However, I find that the implementation of the pre-market session is far more beneficial than that of the after-hours session; exceptionally, the implementation of the short-term pre-market session could induce higher price efficiency and higher price stability regardless of the number of market participants during the session."

Optimization models and algorithms can be applied to identify groundwater withdrawals that will satisfy both hydrologic goals and water demands. In groundwater basins where urbanization increases demand and places stress on the supply-demand balance, safe yield based demand restrictions are used to reduce demands. Due to restrictions for water consumers, safe yield-based demand management strategies may result in unintended consequences, such as welfare loss, which is represented as a measure of consumer willingness to pay to avoid water service interruptions. This paper couples an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework and a groundwater model to quantify the improvement in water resources and corresponding welfare losses through mandatory restriction programs and to optimize the permitted yield for applying restrictions. The framework is applied to identify permitted yield as a trigger that should be used to implement restrictions under climate and population uncertainties for a long term planning period for cities in a shared groundwater basin in the Verde River Basin, Arizona. Results indicate trade-offs between groundwater table improvements and welfare losses for changing safe yields. The framework provides a comparison of hydrologic and economic consequences of mandatory restrictions for and reactive management with varying supply-demand balances. The research will guide water restriction policies and improve understanding of the hydrologic and economic consequences of water restriction policies at a basin scale."

The model is tested employing a combination of moderated hierarchical regression and structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings suggest that agents' intentions to exit are based primarily on satisfaction and perceptions of the compensation plan. Significant indirect effects, mediated by satisfaction, are also found for a number of other constructs including aspects of inter-organizational climate, goal congruence between agent and principal, and the agent's perceived expertise."

The mobile agent is a software program installed in the mobile device to negotiate a diversity of commerce transactions with other mobile agents in the cloud. However, the negotiation plans carried by mobile agents are easily be eavesdropped on by the malicious cloud platforms, since the codes of mobile agents are read and executed by the cloud platform. Thus, sellers can tailor the negotiation plans to cheat buyers for seizing buyers’ profits in negotiations after eavesdropping on buyers’ negotiation plans. In this paper, we consider the buyers can take actions to resist the sellers’ cheatings, which is that the buyers can tailor their plans with extremely low demand to decrease sellers’ profits before migrate to the hosts.

This coherence is brought about by restricting acceptable behavior of agents to dynamic utility maximization and rational expectations. The problem of the DSGE-models (and more generally of macroeconomic models based on rational expectations) is that they assume extraordinary cognitive capabilities of individual agents. In addition, these models need a lot of ad-hoc assumptions to make them fit the data. I argue that we need models that take into account the limited cognitive abilities of agents. One can introduce rationality in such models by assuming ""trial and error"" learning. I propose such a model and I analyze its implications."

First, several studies are introduced based on the assumption that organizational change is now excessive. The purpose of this paper is to propose an operational definition to change excessiveness, and the authors assess whether it is a generalized phenomenon at a societal level. Second, these studies are habitually mobilizing coping theories to address their purpose. However, an integrated model of coping, including appraisals and coping reactions towards change is still to be tested. Thus, the assessment is anchored in an application of the Stimulus-Response Theory of Coping (SRTC). Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative study is conducted by administering questionnaires to a nationwide representative sample (n=1,002). Anderson and Gerbing (1991) two-step approach is used to validate the study and tests its hypothesized model. Change excessiveness is measured in order to observe if it is a generalized phenomenon in the working population. Its effects on coping are modelled through the fully mediated SRTC. Therefore, the hypothetical model predicted that the relationships between the perception of excessive change contexts and negative coping reactions is fully mediated by negative appraisals towards change contexts. Findings – Perceptions of excessive change is a normally distributed and a statistically centralized phenomenon. As hypothesized, an structural equation modelling test of the SRTC shows a full mediation effect of negative appraisal between change intensity and negative coping to change. Originality/value – This paper empirically tests a nationwide sample where organizational change may be too excessive for individuals’ positive coping. It is the first to generalize the observation of change excessiveness as perceived by employees to a nationwide level. Moreover, it addresses the gap between change excessiveness and coping theories in modelling the SRTC through its three components: event, appraisals, and coping reactions. Finally, it presents managerial discussions towards the strategic necessity for organizational change and its potential “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effects."

There are four different trading strategies, and the agents are divided into two groups: those who trade in the stock markets and those who trade in the FOREX . We studied three market conditions: the FOREX dynamics, the behavior of the two stock markets together with the FOREX , and finally we conducted a what-if analysis for testing the effects of a inflationary monetary shock of one currency affecting all of the three markets."
ZhangDapeng2020IoFA,,Investigation of Freight Agents' Interaction Considering Partner Selection and Joint Decision Making,"Zhang, Dapeng and Wang, Xiaokun (Cara)",2020,Sustainability,12,9,3636-,,,Mdpi,BASEL,"Freight transportation plays an increasingly important role in sustainable development. However, freight travel demand has not been understood comprehensively, due to its unique features: freight activities are the result of collaboration among freight agents. It distinguishes freight transportation from passenger transportation, in which travel decisions are made mostly by individuals. Specifically, two processes in the collaboration can be observed: partner selection and joint decision making. Using the supplier-customer collaboration as an example, partner selection is a process for suppliers and customers to evaluate their potential partners and select the best one. Joint decision making allows suppliers and customers to seek common interests and make compromises. As a traditional travel demand model cannot model the two processes effectively, this research develops an innovative econometric model, spatial matching model, to bridge the gap. The proposed model is specified based on freight agents' behavioral, estimated by Bayesian MCMC methods, and demonstrated by numerical examples. The proposed model and estimation methods can recover the coefficient values in the econometric models, and establish the relationship between the influential factors and the observed matching behavior. The analysis improves the understanding of freight travel demand in a behavioral-consistent manner and enriches the body of freight demand modeling literature."
NorgaardJuliaR2017EoIB,,Economics of Illicit Behaviors: Exchange in the Internet Wild West,"Norgaard, Julia R",2017,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The first paper is an analysis of the role reputation plays in the Deep Web using data from the Internet black market site, The Silk Road. This encrypted online marketplace employed crypto currency and functioned over the Tor network. Utilizing a modeling technique, informed by trade auction theory, we investigate the effect of seller reputation. Analysis of the seller’s reputation gives us insights into the factors that determine the prices of goods and services in this black marketplace. Data on cannabis listings is parsed from the Silk Road website and covers an 11-month time period, from November 2013 to October 2014. This data demonstrates that reputation acts as a sufficient self-enforcement mechanism to allow transactions. These findings exemplify the robustness of spontaneous order with respect to the Deep Web as an emergent marketplace. The second paper examines how the platform providers in the Internet Black Market, one of the world’s largest international markets for illicit goods and services, allow buyers and sellers to overcome the problems anonymity poses to exchange. These online markets enable users to repeatedly exchange in an environment with no third party enforcement while keeping their identify concealed from law enforcement. The third paper analyzes the determinants of network structure, as measured by hierarchy and monopolization, by examining various black market networks. We examine structures of networks in the Internet Dark Net (virtual) and compare it to network structures of traditional black markets (ground), using agent-based modeling. The purpose of modeling these two different types of illicit markets is to understand the network structure that emerges from the interactions of the agents in each environment. Traditional black markets are relatively hierarchical, with high degree and high betweenness. We compare the density and average length of shortest path of the simulated ground black market networks with our simulated virtual network. We find that hierarchy and monopolization tendencies in networks are products of differences in transaction costs and information asymmetries. The Internet is an effective way to lower both of these aspects of network structure. We observe that the network structure surrounding the interactions in the virtual black market is less hierarchical and slightly more monopolistic than the network structure of the ground market."

We have to put more structure on the behavior of the ZI-agents in order to address features of the laboratory asset bubble environment.

This article explores synergies and trade-offs between REDD+, a scheme that focuses mainly on mitigation through forest conservation, with ""Climate Smart Agriculture"", an approach that emphasizes adaptive agriculture. We introduce a framework for ex ante assessment of the impact of land management policies and interventions and for quantifying their impacts on land-based mitigation and adaptation goals. The framework includes a companion modelling (ComMod) process informed by interviews with policymakers, local experts and local farmers. The ComMod process consists of a Role-Playing Game with local farmers and an Agent Based Model. The game provided a participatory means to develop policy and climate change scenarios. These scenarios were then used as inputs to the Agent Based Model, a spatially explicit model to simulate landscape dynamics and the associated carbon emissions over decades. We applied the framework using as case study a community in central Vietnam, characterized by deforestation for subsistence agriculture and cultivation of acacias as a cash crop. The main findings show that the framework is useful in guiding consideration of local stakeholders' goals, needs and constraints. Additionally the framework provided beneficial information to policymakers, pointing to ways that policies might be re-designed to make them better tailored to local circumstances and therefore more effective in addressing synergistically climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives.

Part C, Emerging technologies",162,,104584-,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"Traditional operational navigation models for pedestrian dynamics demonstrate limitations in reproducing the circle antipode experiment, an artificially designed multi-directional flow scenario. In the experiment, pedestrians take detours to avoid the congestion caused by others taking straight paths. Although the pedestrian detour action is commonly incorporated into the route choice model, it frequently goes unaddressed in the operational navigation model, resulting in a disparity between simulation outcomes and empirical observations. To reveal the mechanism underlying pedestrian detours in the circle antipode experiment, this study employed the K-means clustering method rather than using a threshold approach to categorize the experimental participants into groups taking direct or detour routes. Following this, a heuristic function is formulated to determine the desired direction of agents in a collision-free velocity model, reflecting the trade-off between shorter routes and faster speeds. The parameter of the proposed function is calibrated using the proportion of agents choosing detours, where the route types of agents are identified by a classifier based on the random forest. Compared to two traditional models that do not consider detours, the proposed model can more realistically reproduce the trajectory distributions, the travel time, the route length, and the time series of relevant variables in the circle antipode experiment. The study offers insights into employing machine learning methodologies for analyzing pedestrian flow, validating pedestrian dynamics models, and providing an accurate simulation tool for designing transportation facilities and crowd management at large events. •The K-means method is employed to distinguish detours from the direct route.•A heuristic velocity-based model is proposed to reproduce the action of detour.•Calibrating model parameters based on a random forest classifier for route types.•Comparing the proposed model with experimental data and two traditional models."

For this we build an agent-based model, inspired by a wholesale market on which we had performed some qualitative field study. In this model we define a very simple negotiation procedure for wholesalers and retailers, who are divided in two populations: loyal retailers who always visit the same seller first and opportunistic retailers who look for the best prices. In this setting, the presence of opportunistic retailers increases the quantity of waste and reduces global earnings for all agents. We then endogenize the attitude of retailers with a reinforcement learning mechanism and show that the number of loyal retailers reaches 80–100% of the population, depending on the difference of prices between expensive and cheap goods, which is the interval in which the production of waste is minimal."

The ABM-p approach consists of a database which collects economic and environmental data, a preliminary analysis which makes predictions for consumption, supply and prices, and an agent-based simulation model that provides an accurate representation of the energy system considering interactions and objectives of various stakeholders. To this end, the estimation and evaluation capabilities of the ABM-p framework are used to evaluate utility rebate and federal tax credit programs in Texas as a selected case study, where the data is obtained from reports by Energy Information Administration, and National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Utility rebate incentives and federal tax credits are found to be the most effective in promoting renewable energy technologies in Texas."
SummersJ.Kimberley2022PSot,,Predation Strategies of the Bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus Result in Overexploitation and Bottlenecks,"Summers, J. Kimberley and Kreft, Jan-Ulrich",2022,Applied and environmental microbiology,88,1,e0108221-e0108221,,,Amer Soc Microbiology,WASHINGTON,"With increasing antimicrobial resistance, alternatives for treating infections or removing resistant bacteria are urgently needed, such as the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus or bacteriophage. Therefore, we need to better understand microbial predator-prey dynamics. We developed mass-action mathematical models of predation for chemostats, which capture the low substrate concentration and slow growth typical for intended application areas of the predators such as wastewater treatment, aquaculture, or the gut. Our model predicted that predator survival required a minimal prey cell size, explaining why Bdellovibrio is much smaller than its prey. A predator considered to be ""too good"" (attack rate too high, mortality too low) overexploited its prey, leading to extinction (tragedy of the commons). Surprisingly, a predator taking longer to produce more offspring outcompeted a predator producing fewer offspring more rapidly (rate versus yield trade-off). Predation was only efficient in a narrow region around optimal parameters. Moreover, extreme oscillations under a wide range of conditions led to severe bottlenecks. These could be avoided when two prey species became available in alternating seasons. A bacteriophage outcompeted Bdellovibrio due to its higher burst size and faster life cycle. Together, results suggest that Bdellovibrio would struggle to survive on a single prey, explaining why it must be a generalist predator and suggesting it is better suited than phage to environments with multiple prey. IMPORTANCE The discovery of antibiotics led to a dramatic drop in deaths due to infectious disease. Increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance, however, threaten to reverse this progress. There is thus a need for alternatives, such as therapies based on phage and predatory bacteria that kill bacteria regardless of whether they are pathogens or resistant to antibiotics. To best exploit them, we need to better understand what determines their effectiveness. By using a mathematical model to study bacterial predation in realistic slow growth conditions, we found that the generalist predator Bdellovibrio is most effective within a narrow range of conditions for each prey. For example, a minimum prey cell size is required, and the predator should not be ""too good,"" as this would result in overexploitation risking extinction. Together these findings give insights into the ecology of microbial predation and help explain why Bdellovibrio needs to be a generalist predator."

GuillemEléonoreE2012Hbae,,Human behaviour and ecosystem services in sustainable farming landscapes : an agent-based model of socio-ecological systems,"Guillem, Eléonore E",2012,,,,,,,The University of Edinburgh,,"Agricultural areas represent around 40% of the earth surface and provide a variety of products and services essential to human societies. However, with policy reforms, market liberalisation and climate change issues, continuous land use and cover change (LUCC) brings uncertainty in the quantity and quality of ecosystem services supplied for the future generations. The processes of LUCC have been explored using top-down approaches at global and regional level but more recent methods have focused on agents’ interactions at smaller scale. This approach is better suited to understanding and modelling complex socio-ecological systems, which emerge from individual actions, and therefore for developing tools which improve policy effectiveness. In recent years, there has also been increasing interest in gaining more detailed understanding of the impacts of LUCC on the range of ecosystem services associated with different landscapes and farming practices. The objectives of this thesis are: 1/ to understand and model the internal processes of LUCC at local scale, i.e. farmer behaviour, 2/ to explore heterogeneous farmer decision making and the impacts it has on LUCC and on ecosystem services and 3/ to inform policy makers for improving the effectiveness of land-related policies. This thesis presents an agent-based modelling framework which integrates psycho-social models of heterogeneous farmer decisions and an ecological model of skylark breeding population. The model is applied to the Lunan, a small Scottish arable catchment, and is empirically-grounded using social surveys, i.e. phone interviews and choice-based conjoint experiments. Based on ecological attitudes and farming goals, three main types of farmer agents were generated: profit-oriented, multifunctionalist, traditionalist. The proportion of farmer types found within the survey was used to scale-up respondent results to the agent population, spatially distributed within a GIS-based representation of the catchment. Under three socio-economic scenarios, based on the IPCC-SRES framework, the three types of farmers maximise an utility function, which is disaggregated into economic, environmental and social preferences, and apply the farm strategy (i.e. land uses, management style, agri-environmental measures) that best satisfies them. Each type of agents demonstrates different reactions to market and policy pressures though farmers seem to be constrained by lack of financial opportunities and are therefore unable to fully comply with environmental and social goals. At the landscape level, the impacts on ecosystem services, in particular the skylark local population, depend strongly on policy objectives, which can be antagonist and create trade-offs in the provision of different services, and on farmer socio-environmental values. A set of policy recommendations is offered that encompasses the heterogeneity of farmer decision-making with the aim of meeting sustainable targets. Finally, further improvements of the conceptual and methodological framework are discussed."

It provides a basic introduction to dynamical systems and optimal control both in continuous and discrete time, as well as some numerical methods and applications in economic modelling.Economic and social systems are intrinsically dynamic, characterized by interdependence, nonlinearity and complexity, and these features can only be approached using a qualitative analysis based on the study of invariant sets (equilibrium points, limit cycles and more complex attractors, together with the boundaries of their basins of attraction), which requires a trade-off between analytical, geometrical and numerical methods. Even though the early steps of the qualitative theory of dynamical systems have been in continuous time models, in economic and social modelling discrete time is often used to describe event-driven (often decision-driven) evolving systems.The book is written for Ph.D. and master's students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers in economics or sociology, and it only assumes a basic knowledge of calculus.

This paper analyzes how a central agent may bring a mixed traffic system including both human-driven and autonomous vehicles to an equilibrium that both maximizes the efficiency and is stable under the control. The evolution of the human drivers’ route choices, as well as the agent's control measures, is described using a joint day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model based on probability route choice. Within this setting, we show that (1) the fixed point of the proposed dynamical system coincides with the unique mixed equilibrium, and (2) the system is asymptotically stable in continuous time, namely it always converges to the mixed equilibrium from a given initial state. We then examine how alternative control policies may affect the transition trajectory leading to the mixed equilibrium. Two alternative control schemes are proposed and analyzed. The first, referred to as the stability-first control, aims to stabilize a given disequilibrium as soon as possible. The second seeks to minimize the total system cost accumulated over the transition period, hence called the efficiency-first control. We propose a continuous time optimal control formulation for both schemes and discuss how the formulation can be discretized and solved to local optimality using existing algorithms. Numerical experiments conducted on two illustrative examples highlight the differences among the three control schemes and how the share of autonomous vehicles affects the tradeoff between the efficiency and stability of the mixed traffic system."

The role of intelligent agents in norm innovation,"Campenní, Marco and Andrighetto, Giulia and Cecconi, Federico and Conte, Rosaria",2009,Mind & society,8,2,153-172,,,Springer-Verlag,Berlin/Heidelberg,"The necessity to model the mental ingredients of norm compliance is a controversial issue within the study of norms. So far, the simulation-based study of norm emergence has shown a prevailing tendency to model norm conformity as a thoughtless behavior, emerging from social learning and imitation rather than from specific, norm-related mental representations. In this paper, the opposite stance—namely, a view of norms as hybrid, two-faceted phenomena, including a behavioral/social and an internal/mental side—is taken. Such a view is aimed at accounting for the difference between norms, on one hand, and either behavioral regularities (conventions) on the other. This paper, in particular, is addressed to find out the internal ingredients required for the former distinction, i.e., to model norms as distinct from mere conventions, and defined as behaviors spreading to the extent that and because the corresponding commands and beliefs do spread as well. After a brief presentation of a normative agent architecture, the results of agent-based simulations testing the impact of norm recognition and the role of normative beliefs in the emergence and innovation of social norms are presented and discussed. More specifically, the present work will endeavour to show that a sudden external constraint (e.g. a barrier preventing agents from moving among social settings) facilitates norm innovation: under such a condition, agents provided with a module for telling what a norm is can generate new (social) norms by forming new normative beliefs, irrespective of the most frequent actions."
ReynaValerieF.2006RaRi,,"Risk and Rationality in Adolescent Decision Making: Implications for Theory, Practice, and Public Policy","Reyna, Valerie F. and Farley, Frank",2006,Psychological science,7,1,Jan-44,,,Blackwell Publishers,"Los Angeles, CA","Crime, smoking, drug use, alcoholism, reckless driving, and many other unhealthy patterns of behavior that play out over a lifetime often debut during adolescence. Avoiding risks or buying time can set a different lifetime pattern. Changing unhealthy behaviors in adolescence would have a broad impact on society, reducing the burdens of disease, injury, human suffering, and associated economic costs. Any program designed to prevent or change such risky behaviors should be founded on a clear idea of what is normative (what behaviors, ideally, should the program foster?), descriptive (how are adolescents making decisions in the absence of the program?), and prescriptive (which practices can realistically move adolescent decisions closer to the normative ideal?). Normatively, decision processes should be evaluated for coherence (is the thinking process nonsensical, illogical, or self-contradictory?) and correspondence (are the outcomes of the decisions positive?). Behaviors that promote positive physical and mental health outcomes in modern society can be at odds with those selected for by evolution (e.g., early procreation). Healthy behaviors may also conflict with a decision maker's goals. Adolescents' goals are more likely to maximize immediate pleasure, and strict decision analysis implies that many kinds of unhealthy behavior, such as drinking and drug use, could be deemed rational. However, based on data showing developmental changes in goals, it is important for policy to promote positive long-term outcomes rather than adolescents' short-term goals. Developmental data also suggest that greater risk aversion is generally adaptive, and that decision processes that support this aversion are more advanced than those that support risk taking. A key question is whether adolescents are developmentally competent to make decisions about risks. In principle, barring temptations with high rewards and individual differences that reduce self-control (i.e., under ideal conditions), adolescents are capable of rational decision making to achieve their goals. In practice, much depends on the particular situation in which a decision is made. In the heat of passion, in the presence of peers, on the spur of the moment, in unfamiliar situations, when trading off risks and benefits favors bad long-term outcomes, and when behavioral inhibition is required for good outcomes, adolescents are likely to reason more poorly than adults do. Brain maturation in adolescence is incomplete. Impulsivity, sensation seeking, thrill seeking, depression, and other individual differences also contribute to risk taking that resists standard risk-reduction interventions, although some conditions such as depression can be effectively treated with other approaches. Major explanatory models of risky decision making can be roughly divided into (a) those, including health-belief models and the theory of planned behavior, that adhere to a ""rational"" behavioral decision-making framework that stresses deliberate, quantitative trading off of risks and benefits; and (b) those that emphasize nondeliberative reaction to the perceived gists or prototypes in the immediate decision environment. (A gist is a fuzzy mental representation of the general meaning of information or experience; a prototype is a mental representation of a standard or typical example of a category.) Although perceived risks and especially benefits predict behavioral intentions and risk-taking behavior, behavioral willingness is an even better predictor of susceptibility to risk taking--and has unique explanatory power--because adolescents are willing to do riskier things than they either intend or expect to do. Dual-process models, such as the prototype/willingness model and fuzzy-trace theory, identify two divergent paths to risk taking: a reasoned and a reactive route. Such models explain apparent contradictions in the literature, including different causes of risk taking for different individuals. Interventions to reduce risk taking must take into account the different causes of such behavior if they are to be effective. Longitudinal and experimental research are needed to disentangle opposing causal processes--particularly, those that produce positive versus negative relations between risk perceptions and behaviors. Counterintuitive findings that must be accommodated by any adequate theory of risk taking include the following: (a) Despite conventional wisdom, adolescents do not perceive themselves to be invulnerable, and perceived vulnerability declines with increasing age; (b) although the object of many interventions is to enhance the accuracy of risk perceptions, adolescents typically overestimate important risks, such as HIV and lung cancer; (c) despite increasing competence in reasoning, some biases in judgment and decision making grow with age, producing more ""irrational"" violations of coherence among adults than among adolescents and younger children. The latter occurs because of a known developmental increase in gist processing with age. One implication of these findings is that traditional interventions stressing accurate risk perceptions are apt to be ineffective or backfire because young people already feel vulnerable and overestimate their risk. In addition, research shows that experience is not a good teacher for children and younger adolescents, because they tend to learn little from negative outcomes (favoring the use of effective deterrents, such as monitoring and supervision), although learning from experience improves considerably with age. Experience in the absence of negative consequences may increase feelings of invulnerability and thus explain the decrease in risk perceptions from early to late adolescence, as exploration increases. Finally, novel interventions that discourage deliberate weighing of risks and benefits by adolescents may ultimately prove more effective and enduring. Mature adults apparently resist taking risks not out of any conscious deliberation or choice, but because they intuitively grasp the gists of risky situations, retrieve appropriate risk-avoidant values, and never proceed down the slippery slope of actually contemplating tradeoffs between risks and benefits."

However, the possibility that disease-modifying agents (DMAs) may emerge requires an update of existing modeling frameworks. Objectives The aim of this study was to develop a simulation allowing for economic evaluation of DMAs in AD. Methods The model was developed based on a previously published, well-validated, discrete event simulation which measures disease severity on the basis of cognition, behaviour, and function, and captures the interrelated changes in these measures for individuals. The updated model adds one more domain, patient dependence, in addition to cognition, behaviour, and function to better characterize disease severity. Furthermore, the model was modified to have greater flexibility in assessing the impact of various important assumptions, such as the long-term effectiveness of DMAs and their impact on survival, on model outcomes. A validation analysis was performed to examine how well the model predicted change in disease severity among patients not receiving DMA treatment by comparing model results to those observed in two recent phase III clinical trials of bapineuzumab. In addition, various hypothetical scenarios were tested to demonstrate the improved features of the model. Results Validation results show that the model closely predicts the mean changes in disease severity over 18 months. Results from different hypothetical scenarios show that the model allows for credible assessment of those major uncertainties surrounding the long-term effectiveness of DMAs, including the potential impact of improved survival with DMA treatment. They also indicate that varying these assumptions could have a major impact on the value of DMAs. Conclusions The updated economic model has good predictive power, but validation against longer-term outcomes is still needed. Our analyses also demonstrate the importance of designing a model with sufficient flexibility such that the model allows for assessment of the impact of key sources of uncertainty on the value of DMAs."
EkbladLiam2021Tdga,,Toward data-driven generation and evaluation of model structure for integrated representations of human behavior in water resources systems,"Ekblad, Liam and Herman, Jonathan D.",2021,Water resources research,57,2,,,,American Geophysical Union,"Washington, DC","Simulations of human behavior in water resources systems are challenged by uncertainty in model structure and parameters. The increasing availability of observations describing these systems provides the opportunity to infer a set of plausible model structures using data-driven approaches. This study develops a three-phase approach to the inference of model structures and parameterizations from data: problem definition, model generation, and model evaluation, illustrated on a case study of land use decisions in the Tulare Basin, California. We encode the generalized decision problem as an arbitrary mapping from a high-dimensional data space to the action of interest and use multiobjective genetic programming to search over a family of functions that perform this mapping for both regression and classification tasks. To facilitate the discovery of models that are both realistic and interpretable, the algorithm selects model structures based on multiobjective optimization of (1) their performance on a training set and (2) complexity, measured by the number of variables, constants, and operations composing the model. After training, optimal model structures are further evaluated according to their ability to generalize to held-out test data and clustered based on their performance, complexity, and generalization properties. Finally, we diagnose the causes of good and bad generalization by performing sensitivity analysis across model inputs and within model clusters. This study serves as a template to inform and automate the problem-dependent task of constructing robust data-driven model structures to describe human behavior in water resources systems.

Undefined buffering components of fermentation media make estimates of pH from acid production difficult. The objective of this research was to develop buffer models for a model cucumber fermentation brine system linking pH changes to acid concentrations. A novel titration method was used to measure buffer capacity in cucumber juice medium made from three grades of pickling cucumbers based on diameter. Fermentation of juice made from cucumbers of different sizes resulted in differences in fermentation biochemistry. The results of modeling indicated that the pH of the medium after 24 and 48 h of fermentation by heterolactic Leuconostoc mesenteroides and homolactic Lactiplantibacillus pentosus could be predicted from acid concentrations based on the measured buffer capacity of the corresponding unfermented medium. The differences for all observed and predicted pH values of the fermentation samples, based on measured acid concentrations, had a root mean square error of 0.064 pH units. The buffer models included a quantitative measure of the effect on pH of the malolactic reaction caused by the lactic acid bacteria. These models may have application for assessing the influence of a variety of lactic acid bacteria buffering reactions on pH and fermentation ecology by linking pH to fermentation acid concentrations."

Because PV modules are fully packed and the sites for PV installation may be remote from investors, it is difficult for investors to determine the actual quality of PV modules. To simulate the information asymmetry of PV quality and its impacts on market reaction, an agent-based model at social network scale is applied based on the data of Chinese PV market. To mitigate the quality problem while expanding the financing scale for PV projects, two policy options are proposed, including information disclosure and penalties. The simulation results indicate that investors are more sensitive to the negative attitudes of surrounding people, and that raising dividend ratios will drive both defaults and joining ratios higher. We further discuss policy implications of findings to ensure the prosperity of the PV financing market and the high quality of PV systems at the same time."

Path data contain valuable information for marketing researchers because they describe how consumers interact with their environment and make dynamic choices. As data collection technologies improve and researchers continue to ask deeper questions about consumers' motivations and behaviors, path data sets will become more common and will play a more central role in marketing research. To guide future research in this area, we review the previous literature, propose a formal definition of a path (in a marketing context), and derive a unifying framework that allows us to classify different kinds of paths. We identify and discuss two primary dimensions (characteristics of the spatial configuration and the agent) as well as six underlying subdimensions. Based on this framework, we cover a range of important operational issues that should be taken into account as researchers begin to build formal models of path-related phenomena. We close with a brief look into the future of path-based models, and a call for researchers to address some of these emerging issues."

Part A, Policy and practice",153,,151-170,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"COVID-19 has raised new challenges for transportation in the post-pandemic era. The social distancing requirement, with the aim of reducing contact risk in public transit, could exacerbate traffic congestion and emissions. We propose a simulation tool to evaluate the trade-offs between traffic congestion, emissions, and policies impacting travel behavior to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 including social distancing and working from home. Open-source agent-based simulation models are used to evaluate the transportation system usage for the case study of New York City. A Post Processing Software for Air Quality (PPS-AQ) estimation is used to evaluate the air quality impacts. Finally, system-wide contact exposure on the subway is estimated from the traffic simulation output. The social distancing requirement in public transit is found to be effective in reducing contact exposure, but it has negative congestion and emission impacts on Manhattan and neighborhoods at transit and commercial hubs. While telework can reduce congestion and emissions citywide, in Manhattan the negative impacts are higher due to behavioral inertia and social distancing. The findings suggest that contact exposure to COVID-19 on subways is relatively low, especially if social distancing practices are followed. The proposed integrated traffic simulation models and air quality estimation model can help policymakers evaluate the impact of policies on traffic congestion and emissions as well as identifying hot spots, both temporally and spatially."

We analyze model output using a series of macro-scale economic & landscape pattern measures, including land rent gradients estimated using simple regression models. We first demonstrate that our model replicates relevant theoretical results of the traditional Alonso/Von Thunen model (structural validation). We then explore how urban morphology & land rents change as the relative market power of buyers & sellers changes (i.e., we move from a 'sellers' market' to a 'buyers' market'). We demonstrate that these strategic price dynamics have differential effects on land rents, but both lead to increased urban expansion. Adapted from the source document."

According to the investors' structure, trading frequency and order submission in the real CSI 300 index futures market, our multi‐agent system includes informed and uninformed traders, and the uninformed traders are classified into three types: intelligent traders, simple traders, and liquidity traders. We examine how tick size affects information dissemination efficiency and market liquidity by observing trading interaction between traders. In particular, we focus on examining price forecasting and order submission strategies. This multi‐agent system reproduces key characteristics of the price dynamics and stylized facts observable in the real CSI 300 index futures market. Simulations show that tick size has a contrary impact on information dissemination efficiency and market liquidity. While reducing tick size improves market liquidity, it also reduces information dissemination efficiency. Therefore, decision‐makers have to make a trade‐off between information dissemination efficiency and market liquidity in terms of tick size. Our model contributes to building a multi‐agent system realistically and thus reduces the modelling risk in policy design. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Approaches used for analysis include the modelling and simulation of critical infrastructure systems using attributes, functionalities, operations, and behaviours to support various security analysis viewpoints, recognising and appropriately managing associated security risks. With several critical infrastructure protection approaches available, the question of how to effectively model the complex behaviour of interconnected CNI elements and to configure their protection as a system-of-systems remains a challenge. Using a systematic review approach, existing critical infrastructure protection approaches (tools and techniques) are examined to determine their suitability given trends like IoT, and effective security modelling and analysis issues. It is found that empirical-based, agent-based, system dynamics-based, and network-based modelling are more commonly applied than economic-based and equation-based techniques, and empirical-based modelling is the most widely used. The energy and transportation critical infrastructure sectors reflect the most responsive sectors, and no one Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) approach - tool, technique, methodology or framework -- provides a fit-for-all capacity for all-round attribute modelling and simulation of security risks. Typically, deciding factors for CIP choices to adopt are often dominated by trade-offs between complexity of use and popularity of approach, as well as between specificity and generality of application in sectors."
GuoYingjian2019Tiod,,The impact of demand uncertainties and China-US natural gas tariff on global gas trade,"Guo, Yingjian and Hawkes, Adam",2019,Energy (Oxford),175,,205-217,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"The uncertainties in gas demand levels and geopolitical issues may lead to significant changes in global gas trade. This paper uses an agent-based model to simulate the alternative market futures under two demand trajectories: a baseline following current policy pledges until 2060 and another where demand shifts to a lower level in 2030. Endogenously generated capacity investments are driven by long-term bilateral contracts between importers and exporters, where investors are assumed to evaluate the potential risks of demand changes while making their decisions. The results suggest that, when the demand decreases in 2030, the Middle East takes the dominant position in Eastern Asia, whereas this role is occupied by North America in the current policy scenario. In addition, the impacts of a 25% tariff by China on U.S. natural gas are studied for both scenarios. The revenue of North American gas trade is only marginally affected by this tariff. Under the normal demand trajectory, the tariff influences the Chinese market more notably in the longer term when global supply is tightened by decommissioning. In the case of lower global gas demand, the market share of Russia in Western Europe could be threatened by increasing North American export there. •A global gas model considering investment under demand uncertainty is presented.•The trade and revenue impact of low gas demand and a China-US gas trade tariff are studied.•The tariff may increase the Chinese gas import price more notably after 2045.•North America is not affected significantly due to sales to East Asia and Europe.•Russia is negatively affected by increasing competition with North America on gas."

Such a system can offer relevant recommendations quickly and with minimal customer input. We compare three algorithms—cluster classification, Bayesian treed regression, and stepwise componential regression—to develop an optimal sequence of questions and predict online visitors' preferences. In an empirical study, stepwise componential regression, relying on many fewer and easier-to-answer questions, achieved predictive accuracy equivalent to a traditional conjoint approach."

However, the dynamic interactive relationships which lead to customer loyalty and profits still remain ambiguous. In this paper, the Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE) model is introduced to explore the formation of customer loyalty in the Taiwanese imported lumber market. Using agents with reinforced learning algorithms in trading simulations, the effects of customer value on loyalty and profit are incorporated and examined in this interactive dynamic model. As results, the positive correlations among variables of customer value, loyalty, and profits are observed. A controlled experiment shows that changing customer value leads to changes in customer loyalty and profits, but price is not the determinant factor for improving customer loyalty. The R 2 values of customer loyalty and profits elucidate that they are increasing as the time lapsed elongate. Providing high value of products and services is a better strategy for suppliers to attract potential loyal customers."

However, the pilot emissions trading programs in China have failed to bring remarkable success in the campaign for pollution control. The policy design of an emissions trading program is found to have a decisive impact on its performance. In this study, an artificial market for sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions trading applying the agent-based model was constructed. The performance of the Jiangsu SO2 emissions trading market under different policy design scenario was also examined. Results show that the market efficiency of emissions trading is significantly affected by policy design and existing policies. China’s coal-electricity price system is the principal factor influencing the performance of the SO2 emissions trading market. Transaction costs would also reduce market efficiency. In addition, current-level emissions discharge fee/tax and banking mechanisms do not distinctly affect policy performance. Thus, applying emissions trading in emission control in China should consider policy design and interaction with other existing policies."
GuillemEléonoreE2012Hbae,,Human behaviour and ecosystem services in sustainable farming landscapes : an agent-based model of socio-ecological systems,"Guillem, Eléonore E",2012,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Agricultural areas represent around 40% of the earth surface and provide a variety of products and services essential to human societies. However, with policy reforms, market liberalisation and climate change issues, continuous land use and cover change (LUCC) brings uncertainty in the quantity and quality of ecosystem services supplied for the future generations. The processes of LUCC have been explored using top-down approaches at global and regional level but more recent methods have focused on agents’ interactions at smaller scale. This approach is better suited to understanding and modelling complex socio-ecological systems, which emerge from individual actions, and therefore for developing tools which improve policy effectiveness. In recent years, there has also been increasing interest in gaining more detailed understanding of the impacts of LUCC on the range of ecosystem services associated with different landscapes and farming practices. The objectives of this thesis are: 1/ to understand and model the internal processes of LUCC at local scale, i.e. farmer behaviour, 2/ to explore heterogeneous farmer decision making and the impacts it has on LUCC and on ecosystem services and 3/ to inform policy makers for improving the effectiveness of land-related policies. This thesis presents an agent-based modelling framework which integrates psycho-social models of heterogeneous farmer decisions and an ecological model of skylark breeding population. The model is applied to the Lunan, a small Scottish arable catchment, and is empirically-grounded using social surveys, i.e. phone interviews and choice-based conjoint experiments. Based on ecological attitudes and farming goals, three main types of farmer agents were generated: profit-oriented, multifunctionalist, traditionalist. The proportion of farmer types found within the survey was used to scale-up respondent results to the agent population, spatially distributed within a GIS-based representation of the catchment. Under three socio-economic scenarios, based on the IPCC-SRES framework, the three types of farmers maximise an utility function, which is disaggregated into economic, environmental and social preferences, and apply the farm strategy (i.e. land uses, management style, agri-environmental measures) that best satisfies them. Each type of agents demonstrates different reactions to market and policy pressures though farmers seem to be constrained by lack of financial opportunities and are therefore unable to fully comply with environmental and social goals. At the landscape level, the impacts on ecosystem services, in particular the skylark local population, depend strongly on policy objectives, which can be antagonist and create trade-offs in the provision of different services, and on farmer socio-environmental values. A set of policy recommendations is offered that encompasses the heterogeneity of farmer decision-making with the aim of meeting sustainable targets. Finally, further improvements of the conceptual and methodological framework are discussed."
PanZhengqi2015Gvca,,Global value chains and production networks: State-business relations and complexity in economic crises,"Pan, Zhengqi",2015,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The proliferation of global value chains and production networks (GVCs/GPNs) has significantly altered the complexion and complexity of international trade. Much research fervor has been generated to examine the economic organization and spatial dispersion of transnational production, with particular emphasis on firms. However, politics and the role of the state in GVCs/GPNs are often neglected. This dissertation thus advances existing research by exploring the political economy of GVCs/GPNs with states as the focal point. In addition, I base my work largely on the regions of Northeast and Southeast Asia, given the regions’ strategic state-led developmentalism and meteoric rise as a global manufacturing hub. I first examine the Asian developmental state model and the evolution of state-business relations within these states as they move up the value chain using large-n statistical analysis. I then investigate the dynamics of state-business partnerships through a comparative case study analysis of eight Asian countries. Finally, I explore the propagation of shocks in production networks and the role of Asian developmental states during a global economic crisis, using network analysis and agent-based modeling. Overall, I find that Asian developmental states moving up the GVC tend to develop tighter linkages with businesses through strategic and aggressive industrial policies and innovation partnerships. Moreover, in times of crisis, Asian developmental states help to mitigate the impact of economic shocks through economic policies, strategy and political will. Consequently, rather than being static, Asian developmental states have been adaptive to changing global circumstances, tailoring policies to suit their local conditions."

Design/methodology/approach A conceptual model was developed to investigate the value-in-use perceptions of AI-based mobile banking applications via five antecedents: baseline perceptions of current bank service delivery; service delivery configuration benefits; general data security; safety perceptions of specific mobile banking services; and perceptions of AI service delivery. Data were collected from 218 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings This study highlights the role and importance of the sequential relationships that impact the assessment of AIMB. The findings suggest that service delivery and the customer’s role in value co-creation change as AI is introduced into a digital self-service technology channel. Furthermore, AIMB offers transaction-oriented (utilitarian) value propositions more so than relationship-oriented (hedonic) value propositions. Research limitations/implications The sample consisted on digital natives. Additional age cohorts are needed. Practical implications As financial institutions redirect their business models toward digital self-service technology channels, the need for customers to feel comfortable while interacting with an AI agent will be critical for enhancing the customer experience and firm performance. Originality/value The authors extend the service-dominant logic (SDL) literature by showing that value co-creation is a function of both firms’ technologies and consumers’ value-in-use, a finding that appears to be unique in the literature. The authors advance the digital transformation literature by evaluating AIMB as an interactive process that requires an understanding of key technology constructs, including perceptions of baseline service relationships, desired service configurations, security and safety issues and whether AI is useful for value co-creation. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first SDL framework that investigates interactive and structural relationships to explain value-in-use perceptions of AIMB."

However, T1DM is a separate disease, and it is therefore important to appraise modelling methods in T1DM. Objectives This review identified published economic models in T1DM and provided an overview of the characteristics and capabilities of available models, thus enabling a discussion of best-practice modelling approaches in T1DM. Methods A systematic review of Embase ® , MEDLINE ® , MEDLINE ® In-Process, and NHS EED was conducted to identify available models in T1DM. Key conferences and health technology assessment (HTA) websites were also reviewed. The characteristics of each model (e.g. model structure, simulation method, handling of uncertainty, incorporation of treatment effect, data for risk equations, and validation procedures, based on information in the primary publication) were extracted, with a focus on model capabilities. Results We identified 13 unique models. Overall, the included studies varied greatly in scope as well as in the quality and quantity of information reported, but six of the models (Archimedes, CDM [Core Diabetes Model], CRC DES [Cardiff Research Consortium Discrete Event Simulation], DCCT [Diabetes Control and Complications Trial], Sheffield, and EAGLE [Economic Assessment of Glycaemic control and Long-term Effects of diabetes]) were the most rigorous and thoroughly reported. Most models were Markov based, and cohort and microsimulation methods were equally common. All of the more comprehensive models employed microsimulation methods. Model structure varied widely, with the more holistic models providing a comprehensive approach to microvascular and macrovascular events, as well as including adverse events. The majority of studies reported a lifetime horizon, used a payer perspective, and had the capability for sensitivity analysis. Conclusions Several models have been developed that provide useful insight into T1DM modelling. Based on a review of the models identified in this study, we identified a set of ‘best in class’ methods for the different technical aspects of T1DM modelling."

I find that when the number of primary bidders is less than 13 (Canada) the Discriminatory payment rule is revenue superior to the Uniform payment across most market price spreads.

The open-access, open-assessment e-journal",6,26,0_1-,,,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Berlin,"The Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution is currently widely used in economic modeling. One of the applications is integrated with the DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) model. However, a question that arises concerns whether the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution can be directly applied, without considering the underlying social network structure more seriously, even though the social network structure is an important factor of social interaction. Therefore, this paper proposes two kinds of agent-based DSGE models. The first one belongs to mesoscopic modeling in formulating the social interaction with the Boltzmann-Gibbs machine, and the other one belongs to microscopic modeling in that it is augmented by the network-based ant machine. By comparing the population dynamics generated by those different agent-based DSGE models, we find that the Boltzmann-Gibbs machine offers a good approximation of herding behavior. However, it is difficult to envisage the population dynamics produced by the Boltzmann-Gibbs machine and by the network-based ant machine as having the same distribution, particularly in popular empirical network structures such as small world networks and scale-free networks. Thus, the social interaction behavior may not be replaced by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

We first attempt to utilize the so-called Madhavan–Richardson–Roomans model (MRR for short) to simulate the stochastic process of the price-change in empirical data sets (say, EUR/JPY or USD/JPY exchange rates) in which the Bid–Ask spread fluctuates in time. We find that the MRR theory apparently fails to simulate so much as the qualitative behaviour (‘non-monotonic’ behaviour) of the response function R ( l ) ( l denotes the difference of times at which the response function is evaluated) calculated from the data. Especially, we confirm that the stochastic nature of the Bid–Ask spread causes apparent deviations from a linear relationship between the R ( l ) and the auto-correlation function C ( l ), namely, . To make the microscopic model of double-auction markets having stochastic Bid–Ask spread, we use the minority game with a finite market history length and find numerically that appropriate extension of the game shows quite similar behaviour of the response function to the empirical evidence. We also reveal that the minority game modeling with the adaptive (‘annealed’) look-up table reproduces the non-linear relationship ( f ( x ) stands for a non-linear function leading to ‘λ-shapes’) more effectively than the fixed (‘quenched’) look-up table does."

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the operations of shared-ride automated mobility-on-demand services (SRAMODS). The study identifies (i) operational benefits of SRAMODS including improved service quality and/or lower operational costs relative to automated mobility-on-demand services (AMODS) without shared rides; and (ii) challenges associated with operating SRAMODS. The study employs an agent-based stochastic dynamic simulation framework to model the operational problems of AMODS. The agents include automated vehicles (AVs), on-demand user requests, and a central AV fleet controller that can dynamically change the plans (i.e. routes and AV-user assignments) of AVs in real-time using optimization-based control policies. The agent-based simulation tool and AV fleet control policies are used to test the operational performance of AMODS under a variety of scenarios. The first set of scenarios vary user demand and a parameter constraining the maximum user detour distance. Results indicate that even with a small maximum user detour distance parameter value, allowing shared rides significantly improves the operational efficiency of the AV fleet, where the efficiency gains stem from economies of demand density and network effects. The second set of scenarios vary the mean and coefficient of variation of the curbside pickup time parameter; i.e. how long an AV must wait curbside at a user’s pickup location before the user gets inside the AV. Results indicate that increases in mean curbside pickup time significantly degrade operational performance in terms of user in-vehicle travel time and user wait time. The study quantifies the total system (user plus fleet controller) cost as a function of mean curbside pickup time. Finally, the paper provides an extensive discussion of the implications of the quantitative analysis for public-sector transportation planners and policy-makers as well as for mobility service providers."

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and quantify the difference between levels of automation of change management processes and to provide input for determining the use of automation systems for change management. Design/methodology/approach Three generations of change management processes are defined to represent progressive practices used in major capital projects over the past few decades. Discrete event simulation was used to model these processes to capture their behavior and compare their performance according to time and compliance metrics. An oil and gas megaproject served to validate the findings of this modeling and analysis. Findings The results showed that automated processes can bring more compliance and real-time traceability, but not a significant time reduction in the change process. This contributes to the understanding of the impact of workflow-based automation on construction process performance. The validity of the conclusions are limited by the breadth of sectors studied and the inability to capture off-line time allocations of the personnel involved. Future research may build on the work presented here by studying additional processes such as requests for information, project change notices, requests for scaffolding, and interface management in various industry sectors. Originality/value A new approach for modeling and evaluating construction management process automation is contributed and the specific results of the paper indicate that automated workflow-based change management processes should be implemented in megaprojects."

This paper analyzes the cross-border trade problem through a set of models that represent different degrees of coordination both between the energy and the transmission markets and among national Transmission System Operators (TSOs). We first present a nodal price-like organization of the system, where Power Exchanges (PXs) and Transmission System Operators are integrated to operate the energy and transmission markets. This system is not implemented in Europe but its success elsewhere makes it the natural reference for the study. We then move to a more realistic representation of the European electricity market based on the so-called market coupling design where energy and transmission are operated separately by PXs and TSOs. We consider different degrees of coordination of the national TSOs' activities to assess the range of inefficiencies that the lack of integration can lead to. The paper supposes price taking agents and hence leaves aside the incentive to game the system induced by zonal systems."
López-PintadoDunia2008TSoF,,The Spread of Free-Riding Behavior in a Social Network,"López-Pintado, Dunia",2008,Eastern economic journal,34,4,464-479,,,Palgrave Macmillan,London,We propose a model where agents located in a social network decide whether or not to exert effort to provide a local public good. We assume that they have strong incentives to free-ride on their neighbors' effort decisions. We characterize the equilibria of the induced game. We also study a mean-field dynamics in which agents choose in each period the best response to the last period's decisions of their neighbors. We characterize the fraction of free-riders in the stable state of such a dynamics and show how it depends on properties of the degree distribution.
OremlandMatthew2014Udet,,Using difference equations to find optimal tax structures on the SugarScape,"Oremland, Matthew and Laubenbacher, Reinhard",2014,Journal of economic interaction and coordination,9,2,233-253,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"The use of equations to describe agent-based model dynamics allows access to mathematical theory that is not otherwise available. In particular, equation models can be effective at solving optimization problems—that is, problems concerning how an agent-based model can be most effectively steered into a particular state. In order to illustrate this strategy, we describe a modified version of the well-known SugarScape model and implement taxation. The optimization problem is to determine tax structures that minimize deaths but maximize tax income. Tax rates are dependent upon the amount of sugar available in a particular region; the rates change over time. A system of discrete difference equations is built to capture agent-based model dynamics. The equations are shown to capture the dynamics very well both with and without taxation. A multi-objective optimization technique known as Pareto optimization is then used to solve the problem. Rather than focusing on a cost function in which the two objectives are assigned weights, Pareto optimization is a heuristic method that determines a suite of solutions, each of which is optimal depending on the priorities of the researcher. In this case, Pareto optimization allows analysis of the tradeoff between taxes collected and deaths caused by taxation. The strategies contained here serve as a framework for a broad class of models."

Our approach compares predictions from candidate attrition equations with casualty data generated artificially from an agent-based model. For situations where the initial regimented structure of the fighting forces breaks down, introducing fractal concepts into the attrition equations proves effective at encapsulating complex aspects of the battle; with details in the time dependence of the casualty data able to be reproduced. Furthermore, measuring the fractal dimension of a fighting force's spatial distribution on the battlefield provides a sensitive probe of the combatants' behaviour. Precise times at which key events occur during a battle can be pinpointed. This study furthers the body of work which considers warfare as a complex adaptive system and where fractal-like structures are expected to emerge."

The world economy was severely impacted and business-as-usual activities severely disrupted. The situation presented the necessity to make a trade-off between individual health and safety on one hand and socio-economic progress on the other. Based on the current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, a broad set of control measures has emerged along dimensions such as restricting people’s movements, high-volume testing, contract tracing, use of face masks, and enforcement of social-distancing. However, these interventions have their own limitations and varying level of efficacy depending on factors such as the population density and the socio-economic characteristics of the area. To help tailor the intervention, we develop a configurable, fine-grained agent-based simulation model that serves as a virtual representation, i.e., a digital twin of a diverse and heterogeneous area such as a city. In this paper, to illustrate our techniques, we focus our attention on the Indian city of Pune in the western state of Maharashtra. We use the digital twin to simulate various what-if scenarios of interest to (1) predict the spread of the virus; (2) understand the effectiveness of candidate interventions; and (3) predict the consequences of introduction of interventions possibly leading to trade-offs between public health, citizen comfort, and economy. Our model is configured for the specific city of interest and used as an in-silico experimentation aid to predict the trajectory of active infections, mortality rate, load on hospital, and quarantine facility centers for the candidate interventions. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a novel agent-based model that seamlessly captures people, place, and movement characteristics of the city, COVID-19 virus characteristics, and primitive set of candidate interventions, and (2) a simulation-driven approach to determine the exact intervention that needs to be applied under a given set of circumstances. Although the analysis presented in the paper is highly specific to COVID-19, our tools are generic enough to serve as a template for modeling the impact of future pandemics and formulating bespoke intervention strategies."
WadaKenji2024EMiM,,Economic Modelling in Macroeconomics and Finance,"Wada, Kenji",2024,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"This thesis explores the behavioral implications of uncertainty in macroeconomics, finance, and international economics. Chapter 1 focuses on the role of model uncertainty as partial-identification problems during financial crises within a macro-finance model. Chapter 2 examines the impact of nonlinear dynamics of return predictability on long-term asset allocation decisions. Finally, Chapter 3 investigates how uninsurable income risk alters currency demand, nominal exchange rate dynamics, and the welfare implications of exchange rate regimes in a monetary search model. In Chapter 1, a general equilibrium model of intermediary asset pricing is presented, where investors struggle with uncertainty represented by a set of models about future asset return distribution. Each model is consistent with observable information and the understanding of economic structure but has different implications for return distribution. Confronting such uncertainty, represented by partial-identification problems of parameters and states, investors exhibit uncertainty aversion and amplify the risk premium, especially during crises when capital within the intermediation sector is scarce. Following validation of subjective beliefs by various survey expectations, credible policy promises are evaluated that eliminate some adverse models from investors' sets as inconsistent with announcements. The efficacy of announcements that eliminate pessimistic prospects for cash-flow growth in the macroeconomy and restore risk appetite is demonstrated. Methodologically, an agents' inference framework is developed from endogenous variables, where ambiguity arises endogenously in the form of partial-identification problems and subjective beliefs, and other equilibrium dynamics are jointly determined. Chapter 2 studies a nonlinear dynamic portfolio choice of an investor endowed with recursive preferences, who uses aggregate vacancy rates as a key return predictor motivated by the recent macro-labor literature. I estimate a multivariate quadratic autoregressive (QAR) process for the evolution of the investment opportunity set. Jointly incorporating multivariate nonlinear dynamics in conditional means and stochastic volatility substantially improves standard measures of portfolio performance relative to using a linear time series model: the cumulative wealth path between 1972 and 2014 by 93$\%$, Sharpe ratio by 20$\%$, and utility-based economic welfare by 48$\%$. Methodologically, I derive an analytical approximation of the optimal dynamic portfolio in a multivariate nonlinear environment embedded in the QAR model. Chapter 3 studies a two-country monetary model with bilateral matching in a decentralized market, in which an endogenous ranking of currencies as media of exchange arises from their relative quality as hedging devices. When currencies serves as intertemporal media of exchange and hedging devices, buyers have generally a strict preference for paying sellers with the domestic currency which is the relative better hedging device for sellers. Consequently, when the domestic currency is a better hedge device for domestic sellers, floating exchange rate regime provides a better terms of trade, leading to higher welfare than fixed exchange rate regime. As a by-product, the model endogenously generates a cash-in advance constraint by which a local currency exclusively circulates. It breaks the nominal exchange rate indeterminacy of Kareken and Wallace."
MehlenbacherAlan2009MSSo,,Multiagent System Simulations of Signal Averaging in English Auctions with Two-Dimensional Value Signals,"Mehlenbacher, Alan",2009,Computational economics,34,2,119-143,,,Springer US,Boston,"Computational experiments with a multiagent system show that bidders use signal averaging to avoid the winner’s curse in English auctions. The results vary with the percent of common value in a two-dimensional value signal, information levels, uncertainty, and the number of bidders. The complexity introduced by the combinations of these factors affects the bidding strategies and auction outcomes in interesting ways—usually nonlinearly and sometimes non-monotonically. Of main concern to a seller is the effect of these factors on revenue. I find that revenue increases with the percent of common value in the two-dimensional value signal, decreases with uncertainty, and increases with the number of bidders. There is very little impact of information level on revenue when values are pure private and pure common. However, for the intermediate cases of two-dimensional value signals, revenue decreases with increased information."

The design team used Simio, a discrete-event simulation modeling software, in conjunction with Oasys MassMotion, an advanced agent-based passenger simulation modeling software, to model the flow of passengers through the airside connector and the IAF to understand the area requirements for processing people at immigration and baggage claim. For Sea-Tac, the passenger demand was based on forecast flight schedules representing demand levels corresponding to 20 years in the future. Since the Port of Seattle's calculation of future flight schedules in 2015, Seattle has seen exponential growth in the international market. In 2015, the planning for IAF passenger flow was based on all international arriving passengers clearing immigration in two-steps of processing - first at an automated passport control kiosk and after picking up checked luggage from the reclaim carousels, speaking with a CBP document verification officer (see Figure 3). [...]passengers had a greater probability of accumulating around bag claim in larger numbers before checked bags reached the carousel because the overall passenger journey time to the carousels was reduced."
KotelnikovaNatalia2016Peat,,Parking equilibrium along the street,"Kotelnikova, Natalia and Leurent, Fabien",2016,European transport research review,8,4,23-Jan,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"Purpose The paper studies the progressive occupancy of parking capacity along the street by candidate users, under the user equilibrium paradigm. The situation depicted typically applies to a parking peak period. Methods In our model, the parking supply is made up of capacitated lots situated along a spatial axis, while the demand is disaggregated continuously in both destination place and preferred time of arrival. Each user selects a parking lot and time from among options on the basis of their trade-offs between walking, driving, parking price and schedule delay. Efficient algorithms are developed and an application instance is dealt with in detail. Results The dynamical equilibrium pattern exhibits parking lots “efficiency regions” in the plane of destination places and preferred arrival times. These efficiency regions are dynamic market areas with strong yet simple structural characteristics, making it easy to assign each parking user to his preferred option and to derive the lot saturation times. The latter are identified as the key state variables for the parking system, since they induce the lot efficiency regions. The equilibrium state is characterized as the solution to a fixed-point problem with respect to the saturation times. Conclusion Our model improves upon previous parking models in economic theory, by adopting a higher resolution in space and time on both supply and demand side. The higher resolution is enabled by focusing on the street level, thus restricting the outreach of the model. Further research may be directed to extend the model to a network of streets, on the side of traffic assignment, and to study parking management policies, on the side of parking economics."
ColucciDomenico2008APDW,,Asset Price Dynamics When Behavioural Heterogeneity Varies,"Colucci, Domenico and Valori, Vincenzo",2008,Computational economics,32,2-Jan,20-Mar,,,Springer US,Boston,"We build a model in which asset prices are expectationally driven and agents forecast future prices hinging on a combination of fundamental value, trend and inertia. The model has a unique steady state and we investigate its stability. In particular the amount of behavioural heterogeneity in the model is given by the number of intermediaries actually operating in the market: we are concerned with the effects that changing such number produces on the steady state in terms of stability. Assuming that the set of relevant intermediaries is sampled randomly we discuss the probability of having stability as a function of the market’s parameters and the number of such agents. Our simulations show that stability in the multi-agent setting does not require that conditions for stability in the representative agent case be met for every individual; so stability can arise even if some of the agents would not be compatible with it if they were the only ones operating in the market. The same goes for instability. Further, we find that stabilising (or destabilising) effects of heterogeneity are not uniform across the market’s essential characteristics, as captured by a given structural parameter: in fact we can identify a parametric region in which heterogeneity is stabilising and another in which it is destabilising."

Part C, Emerging technologies",84,,92-123,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"•A multi-level approach for optimal railway maintenance planning is developed.•We use Model Predictive Control at the high level for optimal intervention planning.•Chance-constrained optimization is used to obtain a robust intervention plan.•We optimize the trade-off between disruption cost and setup cost at the middle level.•At the low level individual defects are clustered for efficient intervention. This paper develops a multi-level decision making approach for the optimal planning of maintenance operations of railway infrastructures, which are composed of multiple components divided into basic units for maintenance. Scenario-based chance-constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC) is used at the high level to determine an optimal long-term component-wise intervention plan for a railway infrastructure, and the Time Instant Optimization (TIO) approach is applied to transform the MPC optimization problem with both continuous and integer decision variables into a nonlinear continuous optimization problem. The middle-level problem determines the allocation of time slots for the maintenance interventions suggested at the high level to optimize the trade-off between traffic disruption and the setup cost of maintenance slots. Based on the high-level intervention plan, the low-level problem determines the optimal clustering of the basic units to be treated by a maintenance agent, subject to the time limit imposed by the maintenance slots. The proposed approach is applied to the optimal treatment of squats, with real data from the Eindhoven-Weert line in the Dutch railway network."

At regional level, the change in a range of economic (i.a. number of farms, farm size, farm income) and environmental indicators (related to soil, water and habitat quality) is analysed to compare the scenarios. The scenario results differ widely reflecting the heterogeneity of the regions. In the EU-15 regions, for example, payment decoupling achieved the best results in conserving the structure of the farming sector, while Agenda 2000 conditions were more effective in maintaining extensive grassland areas.

A new mathematical model is utilized to generate theoretically consistent relationships between economic performance and organizational scale and structure, and to develop a taxonomy of organizational structure. Design/methodology/approach – A systems approach is used to model structural evolution and generate consistent, testable hypotheses concerning organizational sustainability and financial performance. This theoretical treatment seeks to reconcile contradictory views of bureaucracy, modeling both positive and negative impacts on performance and behavior. A variant of agency theory is used as an organizing paradigm, based on three competing organizational needs: control, autonomy and ownership of consequences. Findings – Simulations reveal that organizations evolve through five stages of development: from an entry (flat/parallel) stage, through a hybrid or mixed stage, to the massively serial (hierarchical) stage. As firms evolve, the risk/return ratio first falls as employment expands, but later rises as higher levels of hierarchy appear. Eventually, organizational complexity rises sufficiently to produce lower levels of managerial ownership of consequences and professional autonomy, as well as higher levels of control, leading to a collapse of organizational efficiency. A subtle variation of agency theory is revealed: upper-management may maximize organizational depth, increasing salary differences between levels. Originality/value – This paper uses an internally consistent, deductive framework to elucidate relationships between task complexity, skill level, industry life-cycle and firm age – providing the first known attribute-based metric for organizational complexity. This approach is reminiscent of Perrow’s (1999) non-mathematical treatment of organizational systems complexity."

Part A, Policy and practice",110,,191-201,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"•We develop and estimate a model of vessel capacity utilization at the voyage level.•Empirical results based on ca 10,000 individual voyages for Brazil iron ore exports.•Utilization is determined by freight rates, fuel/cargo price, distance and DWT.•Results are key to better bottom-up estimates of vessel emissions and real earnings.•Policy implications: static utilization gives cyclical bias in emission accounting. The objective of this paper is to determine the drivers behind the utilization of a vessel’s cargo-carrying capacity on individual voyages. Based on maritime economic theory we propose that a vessel’s capacity utilization - defined as the ratio of cargo size divided by DWT - should be positively correlated with freight rates, as poor market conditions will force vessels to compete for lower-than-optimal stem sizes. Furthermore, we propose that capacity utilization is dependent on the distance sailed, the fuel price and the value of the cargo. Using a unique data set sourced from port agent lineup reports and covering nearly 10,000 individual shipments of iron ore from Brazil between 2009 and 2014 we estimate a multiple regression model consisting of macroeconomic, route-specific and vessel-specific determinants. Our empirical results suggest that vessel-specific determinants (DWT) dominate the impact of general market conditions, with smaller vessels typically having lower capacity utilization. The impact of freight market conditions conforms to our a priori expectations. Our findings and modeling approach contributes to maritime environmental policymaking by enabling more accurate bottom-up estimation of emissions. The research is also crucial for improved modeling of real vessel earnings and tonne-mile demand based on observations of global ship movements from AIS data."

These adopters need to learn about the value of the innovation prior to adoption. Although the importance of learning is recognized in most analytical diffusion models, few studies have actually empirically examined the role of learning in the diffusion process. In this paper, we fill this void in the literature by empirically examining the initial adoption and subsequent diffusion process of a performance-based incentive system within a cooperative bank. Based on both qualitative and quantitative field data, we find that agency theory variables explain early adoption. When we examine a longer horizon, we find that although not all local banks adopted immediately, within 3 years almost all local banks had done so. We analyze this process and find that extensive learning-by-doing and strong subsequent learning spillovers led to this relatively rapid diffusion of the system. We further find that the probability with which an initial non-adopter adopts the new incentive system in the next period depends on the strength of that local bank’s social network."

Exponential growth, fat tails, Pareto–Levy distributed upper tails, and upper value outliers, are associated with increasing returns to scale and innovation. At the same time, properties such as bifurcated research investment strategies, bimodal returns to innovation, and Laplace distributed firm growth rates are products of competition. We build an agent-based model of endogenous technical change in which heterogeneous investments in patented knowledge and increasing returns to scale emerge these distributional properties within a competitive market. The combination of heterogeneous agents, costly information, and patents allow for a competitive landscape to persist amidst increasing returns. The ability of model to foster a coexistence of competition and increasing returns underlies the observed distributional properties."

The aggregate approach refers to the diffusion modeling of a product at the overall population level, while the disaggregate approach refers to the diffusion process at the individual entity level.Design methodology approach - The pattern of diffusion of a new technology in a representative two-cluster situation is studied. In the aggregate level modeling, a diffusion model is developed in which potential adopters of both clusters learn about the new technology from each other. This is done by a Lotka-Volterra type of dynamical system of equations. Then, to focus on relatively micro-level phenomena, such as different propensities of imitation and innovation of firms within a cluster, an agent-based disaggregate model for cluster-based diffusion of technology is proposed. In these disaggregate models, the effects of heterogeneity and the inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances between the agents are captured.Findings - The results highlight two major points: first, both aggregate and disaggregate models are in agreement with each other, and second, both of the models exhibit a form similar to the Bass model. Thus, consistent with the general theme of why the Bass model fits without decision variables, it is found that the Bass model, when extended appropriately, can be expected to work well also in the cluster-based technology diffusion situation.Practical implications - This modeling approach can be applied to the modeling of those situations in which heterogeneous industrial units are present in geographical clusters. It can also be applied in the related contexts such as diffusion of practices (e.g. quality certifications) within a multi-divisional organization or across various networked clusters.Originality value - For a homogenous population, the Bass model has been used extensively to predict the sales of newly introduced consumer durables. In comparison, little attention has been given to the modeling of the technology adoption by the industrial units present in disparate groups, called clusters. The major contribution of this paper is to propose a framework for cluster-based diffusion of technological products, and then to present an analysis of that framework using two different methodologies."
JonssonSara2015Teor,,The effects of reward system on bank credit losses – an agent-based model,"Jonsson, Sara",2015,Managerial finance,41,9,908-924,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the design of loan officer reward systems affects bank credit losses caused by commercial clients. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses an agent-based model to investigate how the design of reward systems affects bank credit losses. Two different systems are compared: competitive and a cooperative. The model is designed according to the theoretically derived assumption that a cooperative reward system will make agents more likely to share knowledge with each other in the processes of granting and monitoring credit. Findings – The results show that a cooperative reward system have potential to reduce bank credit losses. The reduction of errors in evaluating company’s probability of default thus mitigates variations induced by variations in industry, region, and firm-specific returns. Practical implications – The findings imply that reward system design should be considered in credit risk management. Further, managerial issues (e.g. reward systems) should be considered in risk modeling. Originality/value – The results presented in this paper provide evidence to the value of considering the downside (e.g. loss) when designing reward systems in banks."

As a result, it is important to understand structural and methodological approaches used in published decision-analytic models for examining the cost effectiveness of 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) for prostate cancer (PCa) chemoprevention. This understanding allows us to provide recommendations for using decision modelling in future economic evaluations of chemoprevention for PCa. Methods A review of the published literature was performed using MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library to identify studies involving mathematical decision models that evaluated 5ARIs for PCa chemoprevention. Published articles were reviewed and key modelling components were extracted and summarized. Recommendations for developing future decision models to examine the economic consequences of PCa chemoprevention were presented. Results We identified seven published models of PCa chemoprevention. All the models identified used a Markov framework with time horizons ranging from 4 years to lifetime. Due to the wide range of patient risk groups examined, PCa risk data were taken from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and other databases or estimates published in relevant clinical trials. Treatment effects included change in the incidence of high- and low-grade PCa and impacts on benign prostate hyperplasia. Adverse events were considered to affect compliance, discontinuation and quality of life. Quality-of-life impacts were similar among studies. Examination of modelling parameter sensitivities was comprehensive. Conclusions Published models have examined the cost effectiveness of PCa chemoprevention; however, limitations exist. Decision models should take into account the full PCa clinical pathway when compiling health states. The time horizon should be long enough to consider the full benefit of chemoprevention while allowing actual time receiving the drug to occur from the start of the model until a man’s life expectancy is less than 10 years. Baseline PCa risk should be specific to the population of concern. Models should examine the impact on both low- and high-grade tumours and account for the impact of 5ARIs on benign prostatic hyperplasia. Because chemoprevention has an upfront effect, the structure of the model should be constructed so that the downstream effect of avoiding or delaying recurrence can be considered. Adverse events due to chemoprevention should be considered through compliance, discontinuation or quality-of-life impact, and understanding the impact of avoiding PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia events are important model properties."

We accounted for these patterns by developing agent-based models that simulate the aggregate behavior of individuals who are searching for marriage partners. Past models assumed fully rational agents with complete knowledge of the marriage market; our simulated agents used psychologically plausible simple heuristic mate search rules that adjust aspiration levels on the basis of a sequence of encounters with potential partners. Substantial individual variation must be included in the models to account for the demographically observed age-at-marriage patterns.
HodgsonGeoffreyM.2014Teom,,The evolution of morality and the end of economic man,"Hodgson, Geoffrey M.",2014,Journal of evolutionary economics,24,1,83-106,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"1871 saw the publication of two major treatises in economics, with self-seeking economic man at their center. In the same year Darwin published The Descent of Man, which emphasized sympathy and cooperation as well as self-interest, and contained a powerful argument that morality has evolved in humans by natural selection. Essentially this stance is supported by modern research. This paper considers the nature of morality and how it has evolved. It reconciles Darwin’s notion that a developed morality requires language and deliberation (and is thus unique to humans), with his other view that moral feelings have a long-evolved and biologically-inherited basis. The social role of morality and its difference with altruism is illustrated by an agent-based simulation. The fact that humans combine both moral and selfish dispositions has major implications for the social sciences and obliges us to abandon the pre-eminent notion of selfish economic man. Economic policy must take account of our moral nature."
SalleIsabelle2016SLAC,,SOCIAL LEARNING ABOUT CONSUMPTION,"Salle, Isabelle and Seppecher, Pascal",2016,Macroeconomic dynamics,20,7,1795-1825,,,Cambridge University Press,"New York, USA","This paper applies a social learning model to the optimal consumption rule of Allen and Carroll [Macroeconomic Dynamics 5(2001), 255–271] and delivers convincing convergence dynamics toward the optimal rule. These findings constitute a significant improvement over previous results in the literature, in terms of both speed of convergence and parsimony of the learning model. The learning model exhibits several appealing features: it is frugal, is easy to apply to a various range of learning objectives, and requires few procedures and little information. Particular care is given to behavioral interpretation of the modeling assumptions in light of evidence from the fields of psychology and social science. Our results highlight the need to depart from the genetic metaphor, and account for intentional decision-making, based on agents' relative performances. By contrast, we show that convergence is strongly hindered by exact imitation processes, or random exploration mechanisms, which are usually assumed when modeling social learning behavior. Our results suggest a method for modeling bounded rationality, which could be interestingly tested in a wide range of economic models with adaptive dynamics."

Vast differences in the approaches and discrepancies in the results give rise to heated discussions and limit the use of these models. Our main objective is to discuss the methodological challenges in modelling the cost effectiveness of treatments for MS. We conducted a review of published models to describe the approaches taken to date, to identify the key parameters that influence the cost effectiveness of DMTs, and to point out major areas of weakness and uncertainty. Thirty-six published models and analyses were identified. The greatest source of uncertainty is the absence of head-to-head randomized clinical trials. Modellers have used various techniques to compensate, including utilizing extension trials. The use of large observational cohorts in recent studies aids in identifying population-based, 'real-world' treatment effects. Major drivers of results include the time horizon modelled and DMT acquisition costs. Model endpoints must target either policy makers (using cost-utility analysis) or clinicians (conducting cost-effectiveness analyses). Lastly, the cost effectiveness of DMTs outside North America and Europe is currently unknown, with the lack of country-specific data as the major limiting factor. We suggest that limited data should not preclude analyses, as models may be built and updated in the future as data become available. Disclosure of modelling methods and assumptions could improve the transferability and applicability of models designed to reflect different healthcare systems."

RauschSebastian2010CoEi,,Computation of Equilibria in OLG Models with Many Heterogeneous Households,"Rausch, Sebastian and Rutherford, Thomas F.",2010,Computational economics,36,2,171-189,,,Springer US,Boston,This paper develops a decomposition algorithm by which a market economy with many households may be solved through the computation of equilibria for a sequence of representative agent economies. The paper examines local and global convergence properties of the sequential recalibration (SR) algorithm. The SR algorithm is then demonstrated to efficiently solve Auerbach–Kotlikoff OLG models with a large number of heterogeneous households. We approximate equilibria in OLG models by solving a sequence of related Ramsey optimal growth problems. This approach can provide improvements in both efficiency and robustness as compared with integrated complementarity-based solution methods.

It is the only rule satisfying any one of the following groups of axioms: (1) stability, rank monotonicity; (2) non-wastefulness, top best, weak consistency, rank monotonicity; (3) non-wastefulness, strong top best, weak Maskin monotonicity; (4) non-wastefulness, strong group rationality, rank monotonicity. These results suggested that two new axioms: rank monotonicity and weak consistency, deserve further attention. They also shed light on what distinguishes the agent-proposing deferred acceptance rule from the other rules."
ZhuZheng2018OaRT,,Online and Real-Time Transportation Systems Management and Operations Decision Support With Integrated Travel Behavior and Dynamic Network Models,"Zhu, Zheng",2018,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"The acceleration of urbanization is witnessed all around the world. Both population and vehicle ownership are rapidly growing, and the induced traffic congestion becomes an increasingly pervasive problem in people’s daily life. In 2014, transportation congestion caused $160 billion economic loss in 498 U.S. urban areas, which is 5.5 more than that in 1982. Without effective reactions, this number is expect to grow to $192 billion in 2020. In order to mitigate traffic congestion, many transportation demand management (TDM) strategies (e.g. bus rapid lanes, and flextime policy), and active traffic management (ATM) strategies (e.g. real-time user guidance, and adaptive traffic signal control) have been proposed and implemented. Although TDM and ATM have proved their values in theoretical researches or field implementations, it is still hard for transportation engineers to select the optimal strategy when faced with complex traffic conditions. In the science of transportation engineering, mathematical models are usually expected to help estimate traffic conditions under different scenarios. There have been a number of models that help transportation engineers make decisions. However, many of them are developed for offline use and are not suitable for real-time applications due to computational time issues. With the development of computational technologies and traffic monitoring systems, online transportation network modeling is getting closer and closer to reality. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a large-scale mesoscopic transportation model which is integrated with an agent-based travel behavior model. The ultimate goal is to achieve online (real-time) simulation to estimate and predict the traffic performance of the entire Washington D.C. area. The simulation system is expected to support real-time transportation system managements and operations. One of the most challenging issue for this dissertation is the calibration of online simulation models. Model parameters need to be estimated based on real-time traffic data to reflect the reality. Literature review of previous relevant studies indicates a trade-off between computational speed and calibration accuracy. In order to apply the model onto a real-time horizon, experts usually ignore the inherent mechanism of traffic modeling but rely on fast converging technologies to approximate the model parameters. Differently from previous online transportation simulation approaches, the method proposed in this dissertation focuses more on the mechanism of transportation modeling. With the fundamental understanding of the modeling mechanism, one can quickly determine the gradient of model parameters such that the gap between real-time traffic measures and simulation results is minimized. This research is one of the earliest attempts to introduce both agent-based modeling and gradient-based calibration approach to model real-time large-scale networks. The contribution includes: 1) integrate an agent-based travel behavior model into dynamic transportation network models to enhance the behavior realism; 2) propose a fast online calibration procedure that quickly adjusts model parameters based on real-time traffic data. A number of real-world case studies are illustrated to demonstrate the value of this model for both long-term and real-time applications."

To describe behavior in such emotion-and reward-laden scenarios, researchers have proposed dual-process models that posit competition between a slower, analytic faculty and a fast, impulsive, emotional faculty. In this paper, we examine the assumptions and limitations of these approaches to modeling motivated choice. We argue that models of this form, though intuitively attractive, are biologically implausible. We describe an approach to motivated choice based on sequential sampling process models that can form a solid theoretical bridge between what is known about brain function and environmental influences upon choice. We further suggest that the complex and dynamic relationships between biology, behavior, and environment affecting choice at the individual level must inform aggregate models of consumer choice. Models using agent-based complex systems may further provide a principled way to relate individual and aggregate consumer choices to the aggregate choices made by businesses and social institutions. We coin the term ""brain-to-society systems"" choice model for this broad integrative approach."

The purposive sampling method was used, and the data were analyzed by using structural equation modeling (LISREL). Findings and implications – The results show similarities in positive relationship between variables in the three types of platform. Those were experience-based satisfaction and disposition to trust, experience-based satisfaction and institution-based trust, transaction-based satisfaction and experience-based satisfaction, transaction-based satisfaction and institution-based trust, transaction-based satisfaction and repurchase intention, and institution-based trust and disposition to trust. The implication is that industry professionals operating online travel agent platforms should not neglect transaction-based satisfaction as it has significant effects on switching intention, repurchase intention, and institution-based trust. Limitation – Respondents in this study only included Indonesian residents, booking with companies in Indonesia. The findings in this study cannot represent conditions around the world. Originality – Most studies on hospitality and tourism only explore one online booking platform as their object although different platforms can provide different findings. This paper contributes to the existing literature by dividing online booking platforms into three types: online travel agency, peer-to-peer accommodation, and virtual hotel operator."

Today, many firms view customers as co-creators of value. Until recently, however, attention to customer integration was mainly directed toward customers' role in a firm's given supply processes. The goal of this paper is to show that processes on the customer side are equally important for the overall success of value creation.Design methodology approach - The reasoning for the role of customers is based on a theoretical discussion of customer integration, blueprints and customer scripts. Relating this work to the general problem of transaction costs from information asymmetries, the paper develops a typology of how customer scripts can be applied in various situations.Findings - It is found that customer scripts can have a positive effect on interactive value creation because they enable companies to build a holistic process image for all process participants.Research limitations implications - Marketing must rethink its role as an agent of companies. Indeed, in interactive value creation, boundaries blur. However, the results lack broad empirical confirmation.Practical implications - It is argued that firms must adopt a customer perspective and provide an approach of how to achieve this.Originality value - The paper reintroduces scripts in the marketing discussion. In addition, it provides a new typology of situations in interactive value creation."

Due to the complexity of the issues at hand and the lack of historical data, the assessment was based on dynamic agent-based modelling with the extended AgriPoliS model. Our results indicate small impacts in relatively productive regions, since land use remains largely unchanged. In marginal agricultural regions, however, decoupling is shown to have a negative impact on biodiversity and landscape mosaic because of the homogenisation of land use that results from land being taken out of production. Existing agri-environmental schemes and national support acted to buffer the full potential impacts of decoupling on landscape values in these regions. The modelled effects of the reform would have been more radical if there had been no link between the decoupled payment and land, i.e. the GAEC obligation."

The method is based on the bid-auction approach and considers that the expected maximum bid of the auction is a latent variable that can be related to observed price indicators through a measurement equation. The method has the advantage of allowing for the estimation of the parameters of the bid function that explain the heterogeneous preferences of households for location while simultaneously adjusting the expected maximum bid to reproduce realistic values. The model is applied and validated for a case study on the city of Brussels. Results show that the proposed model outperforms other methods for bid-rent estimation, both in terms of real estate prices and spatial distribution of agents, especially when detailed data describing the real estate goods and their prices is not available."
YangPan2019RPMf,,Reward-Based Participant Management for Crowdsourcing Rainfall Monitoring: An Agent-Based Model Simulation,"Yang, Pan and Ng, Tze Ling and Cai, Ximing",2019,Water resources research,55,,,,,American Geophysical Union (AGU),United States,"Crowdsourcing incorporates common citizens as rich sources of data and is promising for environmental monitoring. Here, we propose and test the idea of incorporating incentives to crowdsourcing management for rainfall monitoring. In particular, we model the allocation of incentives (quantitatively measurable and limited rewards) among crowdsourcing participants for a theoretical rainfall monitoring case. For this purpose, we develop an integrated model comprising a reward allocation component to represent the decision-making process of a central manager, an agent-based model to simulate the interactions between the manager and participants, and a rainfall simulation model to evaluate the effectiveness of various reward allocation policies. We simulate six reward allocation policies of varying levels of administrative cost, and consideration of participant and rainfall spatial heterogeneities. The findings indicate the performance of each policy to improve with the reward budget and their spatial uniformity. Among the six policies tested, we discover that the participant density weighted maximum participation policy yields the most accurate estimation of rainfall intensity due to its more explicit consideration of the spatial distribution of participants; however, this policy associates with a high administrative cost. This highlights the trade-off between performance and cost in designing effective reward allocation policies. This paper provides a physical and behavior simulation modeling tool to study the feasibility and complexity of reward-based participant management for crowdsourcing rainfall monitoring. The proposed crowdsourcing method is beneficial for a wide range of applications that require rainfall data with fine resolution, such as storm water management and water availability and biomass assessment for food and energy crops."

Part C, Emerging technologies",97,,216-234,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"•Propose an approach to design, simulate, and evaluate integrated AV and PT system.•Model the interaction between demand and supply through an iterative procedure.•Develop scenarios with various fleet and vehicle sizes, and fare and hailing strategies.•Evaluate scenarios for the passengers, AV and PT operators, and mobility system. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent potentially disruptive and innovative changes to public transportation (PT) systems. However, the exact interplay between AV and PT is understudied in existing research. This paper proposes a systematic approach to the design, simulation, and evaluation of integrated autonomous vehicle and public transportation (AV + PT) systems. Two features distinguish this research from the state of the art in the literature: the first is the transit-oriented AV operation with the purpose of supporting existing PT modes; the second is the explicit modeling of the interaction between demand and supply. We highlight the transit-orientation by identifying the synergistic opportunities between AV and PT, which makes AVs more acceptable to all the stakeholders and respects the social-purpose considerations such as maintaining service availability and ensuring equity. Specifically, AV is designed to serve first-mile connections to rail stations and provide efficient shared mobility in low-density suburban areas. The interaction between demand and supply is modeled using a set of system dynamics equations and solved as a fixed-point problem through an iterative simulation procedure. We develop an agent-based simulation platform of service and a discrete choice model of demand as two subproblems. Using a feedback loop between supply and demand, we capture the interaction between the decisions of the service operator and those of the travelers and model the choices of both parties. Considering uncertainties in demand prediction and stochasticity in simulation, we also evaluate the robustness of our fixed-point solution and demonstrate the convergence of the proposed method empirically. We test our approach in a major European city, simulating scenarios with various fleet sizes, vehicle capacities, fare schemes, and hailing strategies such as in-advance requests. Scenarios are evaluated from the perspectives of passengers, AV operators, PT operators, and urban mobility system. Results show the trade off between the level of service and the operational cost, providing insight for fleet sizing to reach the optimal balance. Our simulated experiments show that encouraging ride-sharing, allowing in-advance requests, and combining fare with transit help enable service integration and encourage sustainable travel. Both the transit-oriented AV operation and the demand-supply interaction are essential components for defining and assessing the roles of the AV technology in our future transportation systems, especially those with ample and robust transit networks."

DelloRussoFieldsGina2024StSD,,Supporting the Sustainable Development of Electricity Systems via Consumer Behavior and System Modeling,"Dello Russo Fields, Gina",2024,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Today’s energy and power systems generate many societal benefits, such as reliable and affordable electricity, jobs, and economic growth, but they also produce harmful emissions and waste. Promoting a deeper deployment of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power is one approach to reducing the environmental impact of the electricity grid, although it raises concerns about energy costs and grid reliability. The successful integration of increased renewable energy capacity requires cooperation amongst key stakeholders including government agencies responsible for crafting regulations, utility companies responsible for the transmission infrastructure, and the energy consumers whose energy behaviors shape the need for renewables. Viewing the electricity grid and its stakeholders as a multi-agent system, this dissertation generates new knowledge on consumer electricity behavior and explores novel approaches to modeling electric power systems. The improved system model incorporates a more robust understanding of consumer behavior that can support producer and policy decision-making regarding the portfolio of power sources, the design of incentives, the offering of renewable energy programs, and other policy alternatives.Specifically, this work involves consumer behavior experiments, multi-agent electricity system modeling, and domain expert simulation testing for usability and value of decision-making and trade-off analysis. Consumer behavior experiments examine electricity choices, investigating how social norms and incentives impact consumer perspectives, beliefs, and intentions (e.g., likelihood of installing solar photovoltaic systems), as well as the likelihood of opting into renewable energy credit programs. These experimental results inform the creation of consumer agents in an agent-based electricity system model and examine how different assumptions, model architectures, and policy scenarios affect the system-level outcomes. Finally, experimental vignettes conducted with energy industry and policy decision-makers examine the simulation’s usability, perceived value, and key findings."

This book offers a more effective application of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, on an area-wide (AW) or population-wide (AW-IPM) basis, which aims at the management of the total population of a pest, involving a coordinated effort over often larger areas. For major livestock pests, vectors of human diseases and pests of high-value crops with low pest tolerance, there are compelling economic reasons for participating in AW-IPM. This new textbook attempts to address various fundamental components of AW-IPM, e.g. the importance of relevant problem-solving research, the need for planning and essential baseline data collection, the significance of integrating adequate tools for appropriate control strategies, and the value of pilot trials, etc. With chapters authored by 184 experts from more than 31 countries, the book includes many technical advances in the areas of genetics, molecular biology, microbiology, resistance management, and social sciences that facilitate the planning and implementing of area-wide strategies. The book is essential reading for the academic and applied research community as well as national and regional government plant and human/animal health authorities with responsibility for protecting plant and human/animal health."

It is not known which of these represents the best value for money. Objective : To compare the cost effectiveness of home-based care (HBC), facility-based care (FBC) and mobile clinic care (MCC) for provision of ART in Uganda. Methods : Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using decision and Markov modeling of adult AIDS patients in WHO Clinical Stage 3 and 4 from the perspective of the Ugandan healthcare system. The main outcome measures were cost (year 2008 values), life expectancy in life-years (LY) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) measured as cost per QALY or LY gained over 10 years. Results : Ten-year mean undiscounted life expectancy was lowest for FBC (3.6 LY), followed by MCC (4.3 LY) and highest for HBC (5.3 LY), while the mean discounted QALYs were also lowest for FBC (2.3), followed by MCC (2.9) and highest for HBC (3.7). The 10-year mean costs per patient were lowest for FBC ($US3212), followed by MCC ($US4782) and highest for HBC ($US7033). The ICER was lower for MCC versus FBC ($US2241 per LY and $US2615 per QALY) than for HBC versus MCC ($US2251 per LY and $US2814 per QALY). FBC remained cost effective in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions : FBC appears to be the most cost-effective programme for provision of ART in Uganda. This analysis supports the implementation of FBC for scale-up and sustainability of ART in Uganda. HBC and MCC would be competitive only if there is increased access, increased adherence or reduced cost."

Presently, the Mexican electricity market is presented by the state-regulated monopoly, so a competition market is not yet established. Our work can be evaluated as an empirical study of possible liberalization effects for Mexico. An oligopolistic market structure emerges from the energy market analysis and is characterized not only by the mutual influence upon prices due to the market shares and power but also by the naturally limited number of operating firms-producers at the market. In this Cournot-Nash model, the electricity firms maximize their profit and enlarge their market shares. For a comparison, we also introduce the notion of perfect competition, where each agent reacts as a price-taker equalizing prices and marginal costs in order to maximize its profit. The computational game theoretic modeling tool, offered in this paper, composed as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP), solved by the GAMS (www.sams.com) algorithm PATH. It was applied to the Mexican electricity market data to obtain Nash equilibrium in the perfect competition and Cournot cases, as well as open market scenario with international trade with the USA.

Contributing to the scarce literature on firm migration behavior, we explore and model the determinants of mobility among small and medium size firms who retained less than 200 employees between 1996 and 1997. Our exploratory results suggest that short distance moves are more common and tend to occur among smaller firms. Econometric modeling results support these assertions and indicate that the willingness to move can be explained by a firm's internal characteristics (e.g. age, size, growth and industry type) as well as location factors related to the urban environment where the firm is located. The modeling results will serve as input for the development of an agent-based firmographic decision support system that can be used to inform the planning process in the study area."

We outline a design approach for providing decisional guidance in GDSS and then test the feasibility of the design in a preliminary laboratory experiment. Findings show how decisional guidance that provides system explanations at breakpoints in group interaction can improve MCDM GDSS usability. Our findings support Dhaliwal and Benbasat's (1996) conjecture that system explanations can improve decisional outcomes due to improvement in user understanding of decision models.

This paper presents an agent-based simulation in which different kinds of information about choices are transmitted. This approach also provides a concrete model for certain aspects of “hegemonic discourse”. In standard Rational Choice where options are common knowledge, all actors with the same preferences should make the same decisions. By contrast if information is transmitted socially, the concerns of a majority may reduce the ability of a minority to choose options appropriate to them even without any exercise of coercion or discrimination."

Heterogeneous-agent trading models rationalize how trading volume reflects the quality of traders’ information signals and how it helps to disentangle whether returns are associated with portfolio-rebalancing trades or information-motivated trades. Based on these models, we hypothesize that returns in the home (U.S.) market on high-volume days are more likely to continue to spill over into the U.S. (home) market for those cross-listed stocks subject to the risk of greater informed trading. Our empirical evidence provides support for these predictions, which confirms the link between information, trading volume, and international stock return comovements that has eluded previous empirical investigations."

Our study developed a theoretical model to illustrate the impact of RAs on online consumer behavior. The model was tested through an online shopping simulation which used a collaborative filtering based product RA. Particular attention was paid to the effects of an RA on consumer behavior; we found that it increased promotion and product search effectiveness, user satisfaction with the website, and unplanned purchases. Results showed that our model provided insights into the impact of an RA on online consumer behavior and thus provided suggestions for implementing effective systems."

Design/methodology/approach - The integrated systemdynamicsmodel investigates the structural factors affecting a unique expectation-centered capital value (CV) formation of the prime retail real estate sector, through system dynamics modeling, econometric analysis, and the analysis of planned scenarios. This model extends beyond the usual lags and time line aspect of the price discovery process. The retail real estate sector is investigated within the Singapore context, as this sector changes dynamically and non-linearly in relation to rental, cost and general demand expectations and to exogenous shocks like the Severe Advanced Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. These macroeconomic factors are introduced to investigate their impact on retail space CVs through sensitivity analysis, during the simulation period of 20 quarters from the zero reference quarter (2Q2002). Findings - The paper finds that simulation runs of the expectations-centered system dynamics model are based on three scenarios. Sensitivity analysis is conducted for each scenario. Optimistic scenarios' CVs are lower than those of the likely scenario, owing to developers forming excessively high expectations that cannot be met by the actual rental levels. Pessimistic scenarios' CVs are highest. Based on bounded logic and the conditions for all scenarios, there are huge differences in expectations resulting in a large disparity in the endogenous CVs. Low actual rents are primarily due to poor informational efficiency, as the prime retail real estate sector is not transparent enough, and that many transactions are privately closed. Expectations cannot be met as the market information is not disseminated extensively through the agents and players. The scenarios clearly highlight the problem of informational non-availability in the sector. The main policy implication is a need for a more transparent system of sharing rental and pricing information for the retail real estate sector, which is meaningful for real estate developers, investors and urban planners to sustain the retail real estate sector's viability. Originality/value - This paper takes system dynamics modeling to the next level of incorporating econometric analysis, to estimate the sensitivity of retail rent to cost and the change in retail rent, for effectively structuring the dynamic process whereby the ex ante CVs of the prime retail sector in Singapore are formed and assessed, through a unique and rigorous expectations-centered system dynamics model of rents, cost, retail stock, general demand and exogenous factors."

However, scanty studies exist to inform the role of macro factors in explaining the nonavailability of ACT in developing countries. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the different macro-environment factors affecting the availability of ACTs in the public hospital setting. Design/methodology/approach This study applied a quantitative methodological approach and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test hypotheses statistically. SEM examines linear causal relationships among variables while accounting for measurement error. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess model reliability. CFA and SEM were used to determine the shared variance-covariance of variables, define the latent construct and provide a more precise way to account for the error variances associated with the variables, which, if untested, could lead to biased parameter estimates. This was guided by the data collected from 40 general public hospitals with 283 respondents. Findings This study’s results support a model for promoting social-cultural, technological and legal factors. The availability of ACTs is significantly affected by legal factors. Improving legal aspects by a unit can enhance ACT availability by 0.59. Political factors scored the least, and they do not influence the availability of malaria drugs. Research limitations/implications The design was quantitative and cross-sectional. Future research could be longitudinal with a mixed-method approach and consider other external stakeholders. Practical implications Reducing the impact of the nonavailability of antimalarial drugs in general public hospitals requires a holistic concerted and coordinated supply chain approach that tackles the political, economic, social-cultural norms, technological and legal factors. Originality/value The authors develop and test a model using macro factors: political, economic, social, cultural, technological and legal factors. This model is relevant for many developing countries to supply chain coordination perpetually experiencing medicine shortages."

Proceedings,,,132-,,,Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE),Norcross,"Over the past decades, the volume and diversity of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated by the United States have risen significantly. Together with increasing environmental regulations, these pressures have made solid waste management (SWM) a critical issue for communities. SWM systems are highly complex, requiring a variety of facilities and transfer mechanisms. Unlike many large-scale systems, both government agencies and private contractors work cooperatively with sophisticated network relationships in SWM systems. Thus, the characteristics of each facility, as well as uncertainties at both the facility and system levels, must be assessed and quantified prior to modeling. In light of the economic and environmental pressures facing municipalities, the necessity of modeling and optimization for decision support has become apparent. Therefore, a modular simulation and optimization framework is proposed, in which agent-based modeling captures multi-agent interactions and agent-specific objectives, while operation of treatment and disposal facilities are incorporated with discrete-event facility-level sub-models. This framework provides both global and facility performance monitoring and optimization, and has sufficient generality to be applicable to the SWM system of any region, based on database contents. The proposed framework has been successfully applied at both the county and region levels in the State of Florida. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"
DewhurstDavidRushing2019Smav,,Selection mechanisms affect volatility in evolving markets,"Dewhurst, David Rushing and Arnold, Michael Vincent and Van Oort, Colin Michael",2019,,,,90-98,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA","Financial asset markets are sociotechnical systems whose constituent agents are subject to evolutionary pressure as unprofitable agents exit the marketplace and more profitable agents continue to trade assets. Using a population of evolving zero-intelligence agents and a frequent batch auction price-discovery mechanism as substrate, we analyze the role played by evolutionary selection mechanisms in determining macro-observable market statistics. Specifically, we show that selection mechanisms incorporating a local fitness-proportionate component are associated with high correlation between a micro, risk-aversion parameter and a commonly-used macro-volatility statistic, while a purely quantile-based selection mechanism shows significantly less correlation and is associated with higher absolute levels of fitness (profit) than other selection mechanisms. These results point the way to a possible restructuring of market incentives toward reduction in market-wide worst performance, leading profit-driven agents to behave in ways that are associated with beneficial macro-level outcomes."

The outcomes of such studies are often reported as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with the new agent. Decision analysis can also be used in the context of estimating drug cost before market entry. The current study used neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists, a new class of antiemetics for cancer patients, as an example to illustrate the process using an incremental cost of $Can20,000 per QALY gained as the target threshold. Methods: A decision model was developed to simulate the control of acute and delayed emesis after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The model compared standard therapy with granisetron and dexamethasone to the same protocol with the addition of an NK-1 before chemotherapy and continued twice daily for five days. The rates of complete emesis control were abstracted from a double-blind randomized trial. Costs of standard antiemetics and therapy for breakthrough vomiting were obtained from hospital sources. Utility estimates characterized as quality-adjusted emesis-free days were determined by interviewing twenty-five oncology nurses and pharmacists by using the Time Trade-Off technique. These data were then used to estimate the unit cost of the new antiemetic using a target threshold of $Can20,000 per QALY gained. Results: A cost of $Can6.60 per NK-1 dose would generate an incremental cost of $Can20,000 per QALY. The sensitivity analysis on the unit cost identified a range from $Can4.80 to $Can10.00 per dose. For the recommended five days of therapy, the total cost should be $Can66.00 ($Can48.00–$Can100.00) for optimal economic efficiency relative to Canada's publicly funded health-care system. Conclusions: The use of decision modeling for estimating drug cost before product launch is a powerful technique to ensure value for money. Such information can be of value to both drug manufacturers and formulary committees, because it would facilitate negotiations for optimal pricing in a given jurisdiction."

Methods We performed an SLR on PubMed, Central, Cochrane, and French databases from January 2000 to December 2018. The search focused on cost-effectiveness/utility/benefit analyses. We extracted data on treatment sequences, outcomes (e.g. quality-adjusted life year) and choices of economic evaluation methods (e.g. model type, type of analysis, and method of utility estimation). We analysed the improvement of methods by comparing two sub-periods (2000–2009 and 2010–2018). The quality of reporting and the quality of the methods were assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) and a set of eight key aspects for a reference case for economic evaluation of bDMARDs based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) and Drummond checklists. Data extraction and study assessment were performed independently by two health economists. Results From the 824 records identified in the initial search, 51 publications were selected. Of these, 31 included sequences. Individual models such as discrete-event simulations were used in over two-fifths (22/51, 43%) of the selected studies. Few studies (7/51, 14%) used utility scores based on generic instruments (e.g. EQ-5D). Estimation of hospitalization costs was described in only approximately one-third of studies (19/51). Loss of quality of life (QoL) related to adverse events such as tuberculosis and pneumonia was included in one-tenth (5/51, 10%) of the studies. It was difficult to compare the results of the economic evaluations (i.e. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) due to the high heterogeneity of studies in terms of disease stage, data sources, inputs, and methods of health outcome assessment used. For identified studies including sequences, the CHEERS assessment of reporting quality showed insufficient reporting of uncertainty analyses and utility weights in more than a third of the studies (11/31, 35%; 9/25, 36%). An in-depth assessment of the quality of the studies revealed that only seven, mostly conducted during the sub-period 2010–2018, addressed the majority of methodological quality assessment issues such as the simulation of patient sequence pathways, the use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of comparative effectiveness, the choice of treatment sequence, and rules for switching. Conclusion Our SLR identified a lack of high-quality evaluations assessing bDMARD sequences, although some improvements were made in the reporting and modelling of patients’ pathways in studies published after 2010. In order to improve economic evaluations of RA, clear health technology assessment guidance on RA health-related QoL instruments must be provided, and data including long-term disease progression must be made available."

In this paper, we extend this line of research to determine the industry structures and patterns of expected firm profits for the case when difficulty optimizing interdependent activities does, in fact, generate and sustain capability heterogeneity among firms. We combine a widely used agent-based model where firms search to discover sets of activities that complement one another (reducing overall costs or raising product quality) with traditional economic models of competition among profit-maximizing firms. The agent-based model produces a distribution of performance (interpreted as variable cost or product quality) among firms and the competition models determine resulting industry outcomes including patterns of entry, exit, and profits. The integration of economic models of competition among firms with an agent-based model of search for improvement by firms reveals a rich relationship between interdependencies in production functions and industry structure, firm profits, and industry average profitability."

The interaction carries meanings beyond friendship and is applied to larger areas, such as communities and networks for business, trade, cinema, and broadcasting. In a social network, the user wants to find her/his interests, and by doing so the community, to which he/she belongs, develops and grows. However, the lack of important and useful information, and sometimes its inaccessibility, hinders users from establishing good connections, and as a consequence, it hinders expanding the community. The current paper presents a method of celebrity-based friend recommendation system based on the preferences and tendencies of the user and his/her friends. The proposed method introduces a novel way of extracting and modeling the recommendation process as a game theory problem with two main agents (Celebrity and Non-Celebrity) for selecting the members with more than 10000 followers, as celebrities, to be recommended. We have used the real data from Twitter social network celebrity members to test and analyze our proposed system from two aspects, i.e., recommender system and social network. The outcomes show that almost all the items recommended by MACeRS are celebrities (99%). Moreover, the accuracy of MACeRS is significantly better than other baseline methods."

Due to high density during transit, the potential risk of disease transmission is high, and the government has taken a wait and see approach to resume normal operations. To reduce disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. Cohorting - forming groups of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on locals without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: (i) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; (ii) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and (iii) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and or economic & social activity."

However, it is an open question whether pool-based daily auctions or continuous bilateral trading deliver different prices under conditions of market power. In this paper we present a computationally intensive simulation model of the wholesale electricity market in England and Wales to isolate and systematically test the potential impact of alternative trading arrangements on electricity prices. After eight years of trading under a pool-based system, proposals were initiated in 1998 to change the market in England and Wales to bilateral trading. This paper uses an agent-based simulation to evaluate two important aspects of that proposal. The results show that daily bidding with Pay SMP settlement, as in the original Pool day-ahead market, produces the lowest prices while hourly bidding with Pay Bid settlement, as proposed for the bilateral model, produces the highest prices."

Objectives To evaluate and compare the economic impact of MR and RIT consolidation versus observation, respectively, following the first-line induction therapy for patients with advanced-stage FL. Methods We developed Markov models to estimate patients’ lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and life-years (LYs) after MR, RIT, and observation following frontline FL treatment from the US payer’s perspective. Progression risks, adverse event probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from clinical data of Primary RItuximab and MAintenance (PRIMA) trial, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial (for MR), and First-line Indolent Trial (for RIT) and the published literature. We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for direct comparisons between MR/RIT and observation. Model robustness was addressed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results Compared with observation, MR provided an additional 1.089 QALYs (1.099 LYs) and 1.399 QALYs (1.391 LYs) on the basis of the PRIMA trial and the ECOG trial, respectively, and RIT provided an additional 1.026 QALYs (1.034 LYs). The incremental cost per QALY gained was $40,335 (PRIMA) or $37,412 (ECOG) for MR and $40,851 for RIT. MR and RIT had comparable incremental QALYs before first progression, whereas RIT had higher incremental costs of adverse events due to higher incidences of cytopenias. Conclusions MR and RIT following frontline FL therapy demonstrated favorable and similar cost-effectiveness profiles. The model results should be interpreted within the specific clinical settings of each trial. Selection of MR, RIT, or observation should be based on patient characteristics and expected trade-offs for these alternatives."

Moreover, we investigate the role that the government can play in reducing inequality by implementing debt stabilisation policies, as for example applying a property tax. Results show that delaying the retirement age is an effective policy to raise the pension scheme sustainability. However, there is an emerging trade-off between the pension system sustainability and the extension of the pension benefits that may have intergenerational implications. Pension reforms which reduce the pension age threshold or increase the paid benefit will rise the overall pension expenditure and will negatively affect the public debt evolution which may require some stabilisation measures, as the implementation of positive property taxation. The effects of the property taxation on the debt reduction and the level of equality in the population’s wealth distribution strongly depends on the progressivity of the measure and on the size of the taxpayer population involved. The analysis evidences the crucial role played by the age dependency ratio both in achieving the pension system sustainability and in assuring the wealth distribution within the population."
BrockWilliamA.1997ARRt,,A Rational Route to Randomness,"Brock, William A. and Hommes, Cars H.",1997,Econometrica,65,5,1059-1095,,,Econometric Society,HOBOKEN,"The concept of adaptively rational equilibrium (A.R.E.) is introduced. Agents adapt their beliefs over time by choosing from a finite set of different predictor or expectations functions. Each predictor is a function of past observations and has a performance or fitness measure which is publicly available. Agents make a rational choice concerning the predictors based upon their past performance. This results in a dynamics across predictor choice which is coupled to the equilibrium dynamics of the endogenous variables. As a simple, but typical, example we consider a cobweb type demand-supply model where agents can choose between rational and naive expectations. In an unstable market with (small) positive information costs for rational expectations, a high intensity of choice to switch predictors leads to highly irregular equilibrium prices converging to a strange attractor. The irregularity of the equilibrium time paths is explained by the existence of a so-called homoclinic orbit and its associated complicated dynamical phenomena. Thus local instability and global complicated dynamics may be a feature of a fully rational notion of equilibrium."

By including a behavioral switching among heterogeneous innovative firms, the model is able to replicate, via simulations, well-known industrial dynamic and growth type stylized facts. The main original element of the model is that firms are allowed to endogenously change among three different classes, namely, single innovators, collaborative innovators, and imitators. Moreover, our analysis focuses on the impact of these three innovation categories on micro, meso, and macro aggregates. We find that collaborative companies are those having the highest positive impact on the economic system. Furthermore, we have paid particular attention to the role of credit market in promoting smart growth. For this purpose, we analyze the role of banks as sources of external funds for innovative entrepreneurs. Our results suggest a trade-off between short-term profit maximization and long-term efficiency, which prevents banks to foster investment in R&D and technological progress. The model is then used to study the effect that different innovation policies have on macroeconomic performance."

There is, however, a lack of practical guidance on how to conduct an economic evaluation based on registry data and how this evidence can be used in actual decision making. This paper explains the required steps on how to perform a sound economic evaluation using examples from an economic evaluation conducted with real-world data from the Dutch Population based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies. There are three main issues related to using registry data: confounding by indication, missing data, and insufficient numbers of (comparable) patients. If encountered, it is crucial to accurately deal with these issues to maximize the internal validity and generalizability of the outcomes and their value to decision makers. Multivariate regression modeling, propensity score matching, and data synthesis are well-established methods to deal with confounding. Multiple imputation methods should be used in cases where data are missing at random. Furthermore, it is important to base the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a new treatment compared with its alternative on comparable groups of (matched) patients, even if matching results in a small analytical population. Unmatched real-world data provide insights into the costs and effects of a treatment in a real-world setting. Decision makers should realize that real-world evidence provides extremely valuable and relevant policy information, but needs to be assessed differently compared with evidence derived from a randomized clinical trial."

As independently contracted sales agents, the ISC model is a growing method of non-permanent employment utilized in many sectors. Specifically, this study seeks to fill a gap in the literature related to the under-researched link between ISCs and organizational identification. Design/methodology/approach This study conducts an exploratory, mixed-methods study based on data collected from 189 ISCs from a professional services firm. Findings Results demonstrate that outcomes related to sales performance, retention and advocacy are influenced directly and indirectly by organizational identification. It also shows that tangible benefits related to financial and marketing values are the strongest predictors of ISC organizational identification. Intangible dimensions such as value congruence, management trust and embeddedness play a limited role in the model. Research limitations/implications Results show that ISC sales performance is enhanced when an ISC views their identity and the identity of the firm as highly interdependent. These findings suggest that organizational identification can be a key performance indicator when evaluating the return on marketing investment for a firm. Practical implications This study provides some important guidance to managers responsible for ISCs. First, the study identifies the primary drivers of organizational identification. Specifically, the study demonstrates that financial and marketing benefits are the primary relational antecedents of organizational identification. Both value congruence and operational benefits play relatively minor roles. Similarly, the results show that both organizational identification and historic sales performance are critical predictors of sales performance. Originality/value Few researchers have examined the link between ISCs and organizational identification. Organizational identification is of particular importance in the study of ISCs, as they possess the dual identity of an independent agent and that of a sales representative of the firm they are under contract. This study contributes to existing literature by extending previous studies that examine antecedents of sales performance."

These contracts are restricted to be functions of the ending value of aggregate output. We find strong evidence that only linear contracts need be considered in comparison with piecewise-linear-threshold contracts in the situation where cumulative output is only updated periodically and the agent's utility function is exponential. This finding holds even when there are only two periods and hence one change of action by the agent. However, we find that the best piecewise-linear-threshold contract is significantly superior to the best linear contract when the agent has a power utility function. These numerical simulations also call into question the use of a cap when the agent's compensation is based on the ending value of aggregate output and the agent's effort takes place over time."

Design/methodology/approach The approach involved: collecting data in facilities using field observations and experts’ interviews; modeling representative behavior patterns in the form of rule-based narratives that direct collaborative behaviors of virtual occupants; simulating the behavior patterns in two alternative design options, one of which includes a dayroom; and analyzing the simulation results with respect to selected key performance indicators of day-to-day operations and spatial occupancy, including occupant density in corridors, number and locations of staff-visitor interactions and duration of a doctors’ round procedure. Findings Simulation results suggest that the presence of a dayroom reduces visitors’ density in corridors and diminishes the number of staff–visitor interactions that can delay the performing of scheduled medical procedures. Research limitations/implications A high level of uncertainty is intrinsic to the simulation of future human behavior. Additional work is required to systematically collect large volumes of occupancy data in existing facilities, model additional narratives and develop validation protocols to assess the degree of uncertainty of the proposed model. Originality/value A limited number of studies explore how simulation can be used to study the impact of building design on operations. This study uses a narrative-based approach to address some of the limitations of existing methods, including discrete-event simulations. Preliminary results suggest that the lack of appropriate spaces for patients and visitors to socialize may cause potential disruptions to hospital operations."

Rather than being traded through a centralized institution such as a stock exchange, OTC trades are negotiated privately between market participants who may be unaware of prices that are currently available elsewhere in the market. In these relatively opaque markets, investors can be in the dark about the most attractive available terms and who might be offering them. This opaqueness exacerbated the financial crisis, as regulators and market participants were unable to quickly assess the risks and pricing of these instruments."

After reviewing some existing theories of replicator dynamics and agent-based Monte Carlo learning, we provide proofs of the formulation-level equivalence between these two models. The relationship will be revealed not only from a theoretical viewpoint, but also by computational simulations of the models. As a consequence, macro dynamic patterns generated by distributed micro-decisions can be explained by parameters defined at an individual level. In particular, given the equivalent formulations, we investigate how the rate of agents' recency weighting in learning affects the emergent evolutionary game dynamic patterns. An increase in this rate negatively affects the inertia, making the evolutionary stability condition more strict, and positively affecting the evolutionary speed toward equilibrium."

In particular, we study the repercussions of inter-bank connectivity on banks’ performances, bankruptcy waves and business cycle fluctuations. Interbank linkages, in fact, not only allow participants to share risk but also create potential for one bank’s crisis to spread through the network. The purpose of the model is, therefore, to build up the dependence among agents at the micro-level and to estimate their impact on the macro stability."

Recently, national and subnational governments have begun to restrict the sale of menthol products and reduce tobacco retailer density.MethodsWe developed an agent-based model to project the impact of menthol cigarette sales restrictions and retailer density reduction policies for six types of communities and three priority populations. During each simulated day, agents smoke cigarettes, travel in the community and make purchase decisions—whether, where and which product type to purchase—based on a combination of their own properties and the current retail environment.ResultsOf the policies tested, restricting all cigarette sales or menthol cigarette sales to tobacco specialty shops may have the largest effect on the total (direct and indirect) costs of purchasing cigarettes. Coupling one of these policies with one that establishes a minimum distance between tobacco retailers may enhance the impact. Combining these policies could also make the costs of acquiring cigarettes more equal across communities and populations.DiscussionOur simulations revealed the importance of context, for example, lower income communities in urban areas begin with higher retailer density and may need stronger policies to show impact, as well as the need to focus on differential effects for priority populations, for example, combinations of policies may equalise the average distance travelled to purchase. Adapting and combining policies could enhance the sustainability of policy effects and reduce tobacco use."

The agent’s belief about future prices depends on his confidence in the forecasts made by other agents, measured by the distribution type of agents and by a confidence parameter . The resulting stochastic dynamical system is firstly analyzed in a deterministic setting, deriving conditions for uniqueness and stability of steady states and proving that, for high values of the confidence parameter, no complicated dynamics can be exhibited, hence the new component has a stabilizing effect on the qualitative dynamics. Differently, for small values of the confidence parameter, we prove the existence of a stability region in the parameters plane where the only possible dynamics is convergence to a steady state, while complexity is exhibited outside such region. Starting from the results obtained in the deterministic case, the model is then explored by reintroducing randomness. More specifically, we analyze the stability region in three directions: first of all, a robust estimate of the stability region’s measure is provided; second, a long run equilibrium relation between the parameters of the system is obtained; third, the persistence properties of the series describing the bifurcation curves is performed. We finally underline some economic implications."

Italy adds to this picture a very low labour market participation of the elders, so that most projections of the impact of ageing on the labour market are rather pessimistic. However, there are other long run modifications currently underway that will presumably have a sizeable impact on the labour market, above all changes in the retirement legislation, in educational choices and participation behaviour. In this paper we present LABORsim, an agent based microsimulation model of labour supply, which offers newinsights on the likely evolution of the labour force in the next decades in Italy. LABORsim integrates the current demographic projections with simulation modules modelling retirement rules, retirement behaviours, migrations, education and participation choices, plus a consolle to implement various policy scenario analyses. When all these factors are taken into account, projections for next decades are not that pessimistic. In most scenarios, the overall participation rate is expected to increase steadily for the next two decades, while shortages in the labour force supply and an unfavourable dynamics for the economic dependency rate are expected to show up only after 2020, when the baby boom generations will arrive at their retirement ages. This is not enough, however, to allow Italy to meet the EU Stocknolm and Lisbon targets for male and female employment rates for many decades to come. The sharp increase in the participation rates for the elderly (aged 55-64), mainly driven by the recent changes in the retirement eligibility criteria, will make it possible to meet the Stockholm target of 50% employment rate in this age group by 2015, i.e. with only 5 years of delay.

ChimLesley2010ACDL,,Are Cancer Drugs Less Likely to be Recommended for Listing by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in Australia?,"Chim, Lesley and Kelly, Patrick J. and Salkeld, Glenn and Stockler, Martin R.",2010,PharmacoEconomics,28,6,463-475,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,"Background: The hurdle of cost effectiveness for the selection and reimbursement of drugs in Australia limits access to new medicines based on an assessment of cost relative to clinical benefit. Those drugs that are expensive and provide modest benefits will be less likely to receive a government price subsidy. There is concern that the cost-effectiveness hurdle will limit access to new cancer treatments because of their high costs and modest benefits. Objective: To test the hypothesis that Ceteris paribus , cancer drugs are less likely to receive a recommendation for reimbursement on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) than non-cancer drugs. Methods: We reviewed public summary documents (PSDs) on all major submissions considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) from July 2005 to March 2008. Each PSD includes summary information on the clinical, economic and utilization considerations of the PBAC in arriving at a recommendation. A total of 227 PSDs were reviewed, from which 243 PBAC recommendations were identified. Logistic regression was used to determine the effects of drug type (cancer vs non-cancer) and other potentially confounding variables on the outcome of PBS approval versus non-approval. Results: There were 243 PBAC recommendations in 227 published PSDs: 108 for rejection (44%), 10 deferrals (4%) and 125 (51%) recommendations for listing. Recommendations for listing were made somewhat more often for non-cancer drugs than for cancer drugs: 104/191 (54%) versus 21/52 (40%), respectively; p = 0.07. Based on the results for univariable analyses, there is evidence that four variables have some association (p < 0.25) with PBAC approval, but only type of application, economic modelling and estimated cost to the PBS remained statistically significant at p < 0.05 in the multivariable model. No interaction terms were statistically significant. Cancer drug submissions tend to have a modelled economic evaluation and have a higher cost per QALY than non-cancer drugs (29% vs 15% of cancer and non-cancer drugs, respectively had a reported modelled cost per QALY of more than Australian dollars [$A]45 000; p < 0.001). Submissions that include a modelled economic evaluation and have a higher cost per QALY get approved less often than submissions without an economic modelling (p = 0.01). However, after adjusting for economic modelling, there is no statistical difference between cancer and non-cancer drugs in terms of gaining recommendation for PBS listing. Conclusion: The PBAC applies decision criteria equitably to cancer and noncancer drugs, in that cancer drugs are neither favoured nor disadvantaged but they are more expensive and target a smaller population than non-cancer drugs. Further debate and research is needed to determine society’s willingness to pay for a QALY and whether this differs between drugs for cancer and other indications or for interventions that differ on criteria other than cost effectiveness."
KimWoosung2020TEoR,,Three Essays on Regional Policy Analysis at Different Regional Scales with Various Methodological Approaches,"Kim, Woosung",2020,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Regional policy analysis requires an appropriate method that is tailored to a specific region because of differences in demographics, policy purpose, and the direction of policy. Each policy can be analyzed through different methods or viewpoints on how to approach the problem. This dissertation attempts to narrow the literature gap by developing computational tools to analyze regional policy at different regional scales. This dissertation includes three essays on different policy issues, each of which is analyzed using a different method. In the first chapter, for which the regional scope is the county, I investigate the impact of tax incentive policy using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. In 2013, Governor Cuomo introduced the policy START-UP NY (New York), designed to create more jobs by helping people start or move their qualified business into tax-free zones. Measuring the impact of START-UP NY, however, is difficult because the data are not yet available for causal inference purposes. The agent-based model developed for this chapter is designed to simulate the impact of START-UP NY on the local economy of Tompkins County. The simulation results show that ensuring a stable demand for firms’ output is more critical for firms to survive than the kind of tax exemptions offered by START-UP NY. The second chapter expands the regional size to the national level and analyzes the impact of reducing military expenditures using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Military spending is an essential budget item because it is directly related to national security. Unlike the literature, this thesis does not analyze the relationship between defense expenditures and economic development. Instead, I develop a CGE model to analyze how various industries are affected by defense expenditures, and to identify industries for which increased government expenditures would improve household wellbeing when defense expenditures are reduced. The final chapter analyzes international regional policy to explore the relationship between peace and trade using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. In this paper, I explore the impact of peace on trade and vice versa using a SEM approach. I conduct a SEM analysis using the Militarized Interstate Dispute dataset. I propose two latent variables—peace and trade—to investigate the relationship between the latent variables and the indicators. I found that there is a reciprocal effect between peace and trade. In addition to analyzing the relationship between trade and peace, I extend the dataset to include observations up to 2010, which has not been done before. I show using the new dataset that the relationship between trade and peace has remained stable in the decades between 1990 and 2010."

For research purposes it is important to have large scale efficient simulators of LOB dynamics. LOB simulators have previously been implemented in the context of agent-based models (ABMs), reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and generative models, processing order flows from historical data sets and hand-crafted agents alike. For many applications, there is a requirement for processing multiple books, either for the calibration of ABMs or for the training of RL agents. We showcase the first GPU-enabled LOB simulator designed to process thousands of books in parallel, whether for identical or different securities, with an up to 75x faster per-message processing time. The implementation of our simulator – JAX-LOB – is based on design choices that aim to best exploit the powers of JAX without compromising on the realism of LOB-related mechanisms. We integrate JAX-LOB with other JAX packages, to provide an example of how one may address an optimal execution problem with reinforcement learning, and to share some preliminary results from end-to-end RL training on GPUs.

For two competing opinions the dynamics is one-dimensional and the associated opinion flow is shaped by at least two attractors separated by a tipping threshold, not necessarily located at 50 %. Initial supports are thus instrumental to determine the final debate outcome. In contrast, the absence of a tipping threshold implies a unique attractor making the initial conditions irrelevant. One of the opinions is predetermined to become the majority whatever initial support it has. Accordingly, to make a threshold dynamics non threshold appears to be an instrumental strategic option. An illustration of the possibility of such a reshaping of the opinion dynamics geometry is given using the Galam sequential opinion dynamics model. The key parameters are pair interactions and inflexible or stubborn agents. A new and counter intuitive light is shed on the design of winning strategies in public issues. However the findings pose ethical issues. The case of global warming is discussed."

Rather than deal in vague imponderables, in the paper we proceed to sketch the emergent outlines of the implicit alternative program of an evolutionary computational economics constructed from the theory of automata which situates the problematic existence of diverse market species at the very center of the research agenda, and not, as happens all too frequently, to relegate it to the margins of modern economic thought. The laws that are sought under the new paradigm are laws of the markets, not laws of human nature."

The clinical efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide (in addition to phosphate binders and vitamin D and/or analogues [PB/VD]) was evaluated in three phase III studies, including two placebo-controlled trials and a head-to-head study versus the oral calcimimetic cinacalcet. Objective The objective of this study was to develop a decision-analytic model for economic evaluation of etelcalcetide compared with cinacalcet. Methods We developed a life-time Markov model including potential treatment effects on mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, and subjects’ persistence. Long-term efficacy of etelcalcetide was extrapolated from the reduction in parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the phase III trials and the available data from the outcomes study in cinacalcet (EVOLVE trial). Etelcalcetide was compared with cinacalcet, both in addition to PB/VD. We applied unit costs averaged from five European countries and a range of potential etelcalcetide pricing options assuming parity price to weekly use of cinacalcet and varying it by a 15 or 30% increase. Results Compared with cinacalcet, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of etelcalcetide was €1,355 per QALY, €24,521 per QALY, and €47,687 per QALY for the three prices explored. The results were robust across the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Our modelling approach enabled cost-utility assessment of the novel therapy for SHPT based on the observed and extrapolated data. This model can be used for local adaptations in the context of reimbursement assessment."

We propose an iterative and collaborative approach to model development by presenting a flexible open-source simulation model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), accessible to both technical and non-technical end-users. Methods The RA model is a discrete-time individual patient simulation with 6-month cycles. Model input parameters were estimated based on currently available evidence and treatment effects were obtained with Bayesian network meta-analysis techniques. The model contains 384 possible model structures informed by previously published models. The model consists of the following components: (i) modifiable R and C++ source code available in a GitHub repository; (ii) an R package to run the model for custom analyses; (iii) detailed model documentation; (iv) a web-based user interface for full control over the model without the need to be well-versed in the programming languages; and (v) a general audience web-application allowing those who are not experts in modeling or health economics to interact with the model and contribute to value assessment discussions. Results A primary function of the initial version of RA model is to help understand and quantify the impact of parameter uncertainty (with probabilistic sensitivity analysis), structural uncertainty (with multiple competing model structures), the decision framework (cost-effectiveness analysis or multi-criteria decision analysis), and perspective (healthcare or limited societal) on estimates of value. Conclusion In order for a decision model to remain relevant over time it needs to evolve along with its supporting body of clinical evidence and scientific insight. Multiple clinical and methodological experts can modify or contribute to the RA model at any time due to its open-source nature."

Economic agents directly and indirectly impact the quality of water resources through land use and land management decisions—often with unintended consequences. Understanding dynamic feedbacks between economic decisions and water resources is essential for long-term policies that balance agricultural management and ecosystem services. In this dissertation, we examine three policy-related questions: 1) What is the impact of water quality change in the Hoover Reservoir, Ohio? 2) Are there welfare gains from targeted policies in a heterogeneous landscape? 3) How do farmers' agricultural decisions respond to policy incentives and how does that affect water quality? In the second chapter, we use a hedonic pricing model to estimate the impact of water quality change of the Hoover Reservoir capitalized in the surrounding housing market. We work with hydrologists to link the economic data with nutrient flow data they generated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and construct water quality indicators that represent the expected algal production of the reservoir. The econometric results indicate the marginal implicit price associated with one gram of algal production per square meters per day in the Hoover Reservoir is $3,071.64 to $3,238.80 for housing properties adjacent to the Hoover Reservoir. We also find that spatial heterogeneity matters, as the impact decreases with distance. In the third chapter, we develop a platform to solve the social planner's problem of maximizing social welfare on heterogeneous landscapes. We develop a dynamic optimal control model to examine the tradeoffs between agricultural decisions and water quality impacted by nutrient runoff based on spatial characteristics. We derive the optimal fertilizer choice for a representative farm, and the corresponding tax scheme to achieve the social optimal outcome. We find welfare gains from spatially targeted policies increase with increasing level of heterogeneity in soil characteristics compared with uniform fertilizer usage fee. We also show that there is an optimal level of heterogeneity in implementing spatially targeted policies. In the fourth chapter we study farmers' behavior of best management practice (BMP) adoption in response to policy incentive programs in the Western Lake Erie Watershed. We use ordered logit model to analyze and predict farmers' adoption decisions under different policy payment scenarios, and link economic behavior model with hydrologic model (SWAT) to analyze the impact of agricultural management practices on water quality in Lake Erie. We find payment programs for subsurface placement adoption reduce total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) by 4% and 7% compared with the baseline no policy scenario, respectively. Higher payment program leads to higher adoption rate in the Maumee River watershed. Our work develops an empirically grounded model to examine tradeoffs between agricultural decisions and water quality and provides deep insights for management policies that spatially target on heterogeneous socio-economic and physical characteristics. It links economic models with hydrologic model to derive full understanding of the human-ecosystem, and develops policy tools for long-term management decisions."

In particular, the transmission of information within a company is key to improving its management and competitiveness. Currently, many companies in the construction sector are making a great effort to implement the building information modelling (BIM) methodology. Such implementation requires collaborative work through the Cloud between the different agents in the construction process of any project. In fact, information management in BIM projects is related to the creation, storage, transfer and efficient application of information within a three-dimensional (3D) virtual model of the project. The size of the project also determines the optimal management approach. The main problems resulting from poor information management may be a lack of coordination between actors, loss of information or misinterpretation of information. This work has two stated objectives. The first objective is to carry out a literature review of the applications of BIM technology and the importance of managing knowledge according to International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)- 19650. The second objective is to propose a disruptive method based on the Kanban tool to properly manage BIM information in the design and construction phases.

Although organization scientists have studied complex organizations for many years, a developing set of conceptual and computational tools makes possible new approaches to modeling nonlinear interactions within and between organizations. Complex adaptive system models represent a genuinely new way of simplifying the complex. They are characterized by four key elements: agents with schemata, self-organizing networks sustained by importing energy, coevolution to the edge of chaos, and system evolution based on recombination. New types of models that incorporate these elements will push organization science forward by merging empirical observation with computational agent-based simulation. Applying complex adaptive systems models to strategic management leads to an emphasis on building systems that can rapidly evolve effective adaptive solutions. Strategic direction of complex organizations consists of establishing and modifying environments within which effective, improvised, self-organized solutions can evolve. Managers influence strategic behavior by altering the fitness landscape for local agents and reconfiguring the organizational architecture within which agents adapt."

Design/methodology/approach Lean concepts are being increasingly applied by electrical and electronics component manufacturers to enhance product value through streamlined process. To facilitate smooth adoption of lean concepts, barriers need to be analyzed and prioritized. In this context, a structural model of 24 barriers is developed through total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) approach. Findings ‘Changing governmental policies,’ ‘poor selection of change agents and improvement teams,’ ‘lack of top management commitment understanding and support of the system,’ ‘lack of team autonomy,’ ‘lack of flexibility and versatility’ and ‘lack of customer focus/involvement’ are found to be the dominant barriers based on TISM study. Interpretation statements are being derived from TISM model. Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification analysis is conducted. Research limitations/implications In the present paper, 24 barriers are considered. In future, additional barriers could be considered to deal with managerial advancements. Practical implications The paper reports the practical case of analysis of barriers to lean adoption in electronics component manufacture. Hence, the inferences have practical relevance.

This paper reviews economic models of CML treatment to learn lessons from this experience and support ongoing efforts to model CML. A search of databases and submissions to key health technology assessment agencies identified 12 studies that reported 22 models. Common practice included the use of cohort Markov models—most models used health states organised around the key stages in CML: chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast phase—and the use of utility estimates in the literature that correspond with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. Two key areas of uncertainty were the extrapolation of survival outcomes beyond the period observed by the trial; and the effectiveness of second-line therapies. Further work is required to overcome these uncertainties in existing models, such as longer-term trial data collection, including trials of second-line therapies; validation of health-related quality-of-life instruments; and the testing of alternative modelling approaches. In the meantime, it is important that the impact of uncertainties is tested through the use of sensitivity and scenario analysis."

Lower manufacturing cost has been widely claimed as an intuitive feature of the platform by the plant-made biologics community, even though cost information resides within a few private companies and studies accurately documenting such an advantage have been lacking. We present two technoeconomic case studies representing plant-made enzymes for diverse applications: human butyrylcholinesterase produced indoors for use as a medical countermeasure and cellulases produced in the field for the conversion of cellulosic biomass into ethanol as a fuel extender. Production economics were modeled based on results reported with the latest-generation expression technologies on Nicotiana host plants. We evaluated process unit operations and calculated bulk active and per-dose or per-unit costs using SuperPro Designer modeling software. Our analyses indicate that substantial cost advantages over alternative platforms can be achieved with plant systems, but these advantages are molecule/product-specific and depend on the relative cost-efficiencies of alternative sources of the same product."

These responses are, in part, modulated by political relationships under cultural norms that dominate the institutional and collective decisions of public and private actors. The legacy of these decisions, which are often associated with investment in hard and soft infrastructure, has lasting consequences that influence current and future vulnerabilities. Making those decisions visible, and tractable is, therefore, an urgent research and political challenge in vulnerability assessments. In this work, we present a modeling framework to explore scenarios of institutional decision-making and socio-political processes and the resultant effects on spatial patterns of vulnerability. The approach entails using multi-criteria decision analysis, agent-based models, and geographic information simulation. The approach allows for the exploration of uncertainties, spatial patterns, thresholds, and the sensitivities of vulnerability outcomes to different policy scenarios. Here, we present the operationalization of the framework through an intentionally simplified model example of the governance of water in Mexico City. We discuss results from this example as part of a larger effort to empirically implement the framework to explore sociohydrological risk patterns and trade-offs of vulnerability in real urban landscapes. •Urban politics is rarely considered in vulnerability analyses.•We present an approach to integrate socio-politics into environmental risk modeling.•A stylized example demonstrates the influence of socio-political forces on vulnerability.•Trade-offs, sensitivities, and spatial patterns outcomes from political forces are analyzed."
ValenteMarco2014ANmf,,An NK-like model for complexity,"Valente, Marco",2014,Journal of evolutionary economics,24,1,107-134,,,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Berlin/Heidelberg,"The level and nature of complexity is widely regarded as an important determinant of a number of economic, technological and organizational phenomena. A popular modeling tool for the representation of complexity in economics and organizational sciences is the NK model that represents the complexity stemming from the interactions among the elements of a system. This paper proposes an enhanced model for complexity that, though maintaining the core design (and properties) of the NK model, provides a more intuitive and richer representation of complexity, extending its applications and deepening the understanding of its effects on economic systems. The proposed pseudo-NK ( p NK) model is defined on real-valued variables, as opposed to the binary variables required by NK, so as to allow for richer and more intuitive definitions of distance and search strategies. It also admits as a source of complexity not only the number of interactions, as in NK, but also their intensity, opening a novel way to express and measure the level of complexity. Finally, instead of relying on statistical properties of a large dataset of random values, p NK is defined as a deterministic function, far simpler to implement, to interpret and to calibrate for specific requirements. The paper replicates known results and presents original ones; in both cases, the proposed model proves a powerful tool for the investigation of the role of complexity, particularly in agent-based models."

Design/methodology/approach To understand the customers’ behavioral intention and AUE of AI-powered chatbots for tourism, the mixed-method design was used whereby qualitative and quantitative techniques were combined. A total of 36 senior managers and executives from the travel agencies were interviewed and the analysis of interview data was done using NVivo 8.0 software. A total of 1,480 customers were surveyed and the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Findings As per the results, the predictors of chatbot adoption intention (AIN) are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived trust (PTR), perceived intelligence (PNT) and anthropomorphism (ANM). Technological anxiety (TXN) does not influence the chatbot AIN. Stickiness to traditional human travel agents negatively moderates the relation of AIN and AUE of chatbots in tourism and provides deeper insights into manager’s commitment to providing travel planning services using AI-based chatbots. Practical implications This research presents unique practical insights to the practitioners, managers and executives in the tourism industry, system designers and developers of AI-based chatbot technologies to understand the antecedents of chatbot adoption by travelers. TXN is a vital concern for the customers; so, designers and developers should ensure that chatbots are easily accessible, have a user-friendly interface, be more human-like and communicate in various native languages with the customers. Originality/value This study contributes theoretically by extending the TAM to provide better explanatory power with human–robot interaction context-specific constructs – PTR, PNT, ANM and TXN – to examine the customers’ chatbot AIN. This is the first step in the direction to empirically test and validate a theoretical model for chatbots’ adoption and usage, which is a disruptive technology in the hospitality and tourism sector in an emerging economy such as India."

The trade‐offs between costs and survival for these two regimens have not been explored. METHODS A post‐hoc, incremental cost‐effectiveness (ICE) projection using simulated cohorts of patients starting FOLFOX or IFL was tracked for major clinical events, toxicities, and survival. Recurrence and survival risks were based on clinical trial data. Resource use was projected using observed dose intensity, duration of therapy, delays in therapy, and toxicities Grade > 2 in N9741. The frequency, costs, and consequences of second‐line therapy were examined. The time frame was 5 years, and the perspective was that of Medicare as a third‐party payer. RESULTS Initial treatment with FOLFOX versus IFL had an average incremental cost of $29,523, a survival benefit of 4.4 months, and an ICE of $80,410 per life year (LY), $111,890 per quality‐adjusted LY, and $89,080 per progression‐free year. By using the 95% confidence interval for the time to progression observed in N9741, the ICE associated with FOLFOX ranged from $121,220 to $59,250 per LY. In the clinical trial, dose delays and skipped doses were frequent. If progression‐free patients were treated without delay for the first year or lifetime, then the ICE for FOLFOX increased to $117,910 and $222,200 per LY, respectively. The ICE increased to $84,780 per LY when the model incorporated a revised IFL schedule with lower early toxicity and similar rates of treatment with second‐line regimens. CONCLUSIONS FOLFOX provided substantial benefits that incurred substantial additional costs. The ICE for FOLFOX fell into the upper range of commonly accepted oncology interventions in the context of the United States healthcare system. Cancer 2005. © 2005 American Cancer Society. On the basis of results from the randomized Intergroup N9741 comparison of oxaliplatin and infusional fluorouracil (FOLFOX) with irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil, FOLFOX has been embraced rapidly in the United States as a standard of care. A computer model based on the benefits, toxicities, and survival reported in that trial projected the incremental cost effectiveness of FOLFOX at $80,410 per additional life year gained, an amount that falls in the upper range of commonly accepted oncology interventions."

Improving the adaptive capacity of small-scale irrigation systems to the impacts of climate change is crucial for food security in Asia. This study analyzes the capacity of small-scale irrigation systems dependent on the Asian monsoon to adapt to variability in river discharge caused by climate change. Our study is motivated by the Pumpa irrigation system, a small-scale irrigation system located in Nepal that is a model for this type of system. We developed an agent-based model in which we simulated the decisions farmers make about the irrigation strategy to use according to available water flow. Given the uncertainty associated with how climate change may affect the Asian monsoon, we simulated the performance of the system under different projections of climate change in the region (increase and decrease in rainfall, reduction and expansion of the monsoon season, and changes in the timing of the onset of the monsoon). Accordingly to our simulations, farmers might need to adapt to rainfall intensification and a late onset in the monsoon season. The demands for collective action among farmers (e.g. infrastructure repair, meetings, decisions, etc.) might increase considerably due to climate change. Although our model suggests that investment in new infrastructure might increase the performance of the system under some climate change scenarios, the high inequality among farmers when water availability is reduced might hinder the efficiency of these measures due to a reduction of farmers’ willingness to cooperate. Our modeling exercise helps to hypothesize about the most sensitive climate change scenarios for smallscale irrigation farming in Nepal and helps to frame a discussion of some possible solutions and fundamental trade-offs in the process of adaptation to improve for food and water security under climate change."

Although the importance of contextual influences for contraceptive behavior is well established in the literature, relatively little research has been conducted that explores how behavior is influenced by historical and contemporaneous contextual factors and by individual life experiences. In addition, much of this research has neglected the role of the normative environment within which contraceptive use takes place. The focus of this paper centers on the effect of contraceptive environment at both early and late stages of the life course and on how this effect is shaped by individual experience with migration to urban areas. This study takes advantage of a unique, prospective longitudinal data set with detailed information on community context at multiple points in time, an important improvement upon prior research. The results show that contraceptive behavior is particularly responsive to current community context, with past context primarily exerting an indirect effect on behavior through shaping current contextual influences."
RivkinJanW2001RKRW,,Reproducing Knowledge: Replication Without Imitation at Moderate Complexity,"Rivkin, Jan W",2001,"Organization science (Providence, R.I.)",12,3,274-293,,,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"The complexity of a firm's strategy affects both the ease with which the firm can replicate the strategy in a new setting and the ease with which rivals can imitate it. Simple strategies are as readily imitated as replicated, and highly intricate strategies resist imitation and replication equally. At moderate levels of complexity, however, a wedge develops between the ease of replication and the difficulty of imitation, so long as the replicator has better information than the imitator about the original success. An agent-based simulation model clarifies the structural reasons that this is so. The model also shows how the wedge-maximizing level of complexity varies with the replicator's informational edge over the imitator. The results help to pinpoint situations in which strategies requiring replication are likely to defy imitation and generate sustained competitive advantage. More generally, the analysis sheds light on the value of superior but imperfect information about good solutions to hard problems. Finally, the results suggest that a pattern long observed by organization scholars--that ""loosely coupled organizations"" are especially effective competitors--may arise for a very different reason than is normally posited."

The agglomeration has to struggle with archetypical problems of former monofunctional manufacturing cities. Surprisingly, the image of a shrinking city has to be refuted if you shift the focus from socioeconomic wealth to its morphological extension. Thus, it is the objective of this study to meet the challenge of modeling urban sprawl and demographic decline by combining two artificial intelligent solutions: The popular urban cellular automaton SLEUTH simulates urban growth using four simple but effective growth rules. In order to improve its performance, SLEUTH has been modified among others by combining it with a robust probability map based on support vector machines. Additionally, a complex multi-agent system is developed to simulate residential mobility in a shrinking city agglomeration: residential mobility and the housing market of shrinking city systems focuses on the dynamic of interregional housing markets implying the development of potential dwelling areas. The multi-agent system comprises the simulation of population patterns, housing prices, and housing demand in shrinking city agglomerations. Both models are calibrated and validated regarding their localization and quantification performance. Subsequently, the urban landscape configuration and composition of the Ruhr 2025 are simulated. A simple spatial join is used to combine the results serving as valuable inputs for future regional planning in the context of multifarious demographic change and preceding urban growth."

This paper tests some popular saving rules in an adaptive-evolutionary context of looking at their relative survival values. The three types are prudent, shortsighted, and responsive to the permanent-income hypothesis. It is found that where selection pressure is very high, only the prudent type persists. The second most resilient seems to be the short-sighted type, but all three coexist even at medium levels of selection pressure. When the efficiency of capital approaches the level usually assumed in macroeconomics, the prudent type drives the economy towards excessive accumulation of capital, i. e. a long-term savings rate that exceeds the golden rule. If credit constraints are relaxed, this tendency strengthens as credit grows and capital-owners seem to allow themselves to be ""exploited"" by workers. From the angle of average consumption, the best outcome is obtained from a random distribution of types, although this is accompanied by higher volatility."
AscheCarlV.2014RoMU,,Review of Models Used in Economic Analyses of New Oral Treatments for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Asche, Carl V. and Hippler, Stephen E. and Eurich, Dean T.",2014,PharmacoEconomics,32,1,15-27,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,"Background Economic models are considered to be important, as they help evaluate the long-term impact of diabetes treatment. To date, it appears that no article has reviewed and critically appraised the cost-effectiveness models developed to evaluate new oral treatments [glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors] for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Objectives This study aimed to provide insight into the utilization of cost-effectiveness modelling methods. The focus of our study was aimed at the applicability of these models, particularly around the major assumptions related to the clinical parameters (glycated haemoglobin [A 1c ], systolic blood pressure [SBP], lipids and weight) used in the models, and subsequent clinical outcomes. Methods MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1 January 2004 to 14 February 2013 in order to identify published cost-effectiveness evaluations for the treatment of T2DM by new oral treatments (GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors). Once identified, the articles were reviewed and grouped together according to the type of model. The following data were captured for each study: comparators; country; evaluation and key cost drivers; time horizon; perspective; discounting rates; currency/year; cost-effectiveness threshold, sensitivity analysis; and cost-effectiveness analysis curves. Results A total of 15 studies were identified in our review. Nearly all of the models utilized a health care payer perspective and provided a lifetime horizon. The CORE Diabetes Model, UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model, Cardiff Diabetes Model, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Diabetes Cost-Effectiveness Group Model and Diabetes Mellitus Model were cited. With the exception of two studies, all of the studies made significant assumptions surrounding the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors on clinical parameters and subsequent short- and long-term outcomes. Moreover, often the differences in the clinical parameters were relatively small (e.g. 1 or 2 mmHg in blood pressure) and would not be considered by many as clinically important. Yet, the impact of these small clinical changes often resulted in large lifetime changes in health outcomes in the models. In particular, many studies assumed that changes in weight associated with the therapies would equate to improved outcomes, despite limited evidence for this assumption. Although the new oral treatments were regarded as cost effective in most studies based upon the studies reviewed, the validity of these projections, particularly for the longer time frames, is questionable. Indeed, although most of these studies have been conducted in the last 5 years, recent trial evidence has already questioned the validity of most of these studies. Conclusion It is clear that a number of changes are required in the evaluation of diabetes therapies. First and foremost, the basic models need to be updated to include contemporary important clinical trial data assessing hard clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. Second, there should be less emphasis on 40-year or lifetime costs and consequences of the therapies and a greater focus on short-term (5-year) and intermediate-term (10-year) outcomes. Practice is continually evolving, and the probability that these models would provide any valid predictions beyond 10 years is remote. Third, all modellers should immediately remove the basic assumption that small clinically inconsequential changes in A 1c , SBP, lipids and weight result in major clinical improvements in patients. Future models should aim to include all relevant treatment outcomes, whether these relate to effects on underlying diabetes and its complications or to short- or long-term side effects of treatment. We need to explore why cost-saving interventions could benefit further from adding patient characteristics, which may be able to better predict the use of lower-cost alternatives. Moreover, the vast array of different clinical, cost and utility data used in the different models reviewed makes it apparent that a uniform methodology should be developed for diabetes economic models. In this manner, future models could be run using the same data, which would allow for more acceptable comparability between studies."

In order to fully assess the implications of this study, economic modelling extrapolating over a longer term is required. Objective The aim of this study was to simulate the course of HIV and its management, including the multiple factors known to be of importance in ART. Methods A comprehensive discrete event simulation was created to represent, as realistically as possible, ART management and HIV outcomes. The model was focused on patients for whom clinicians believed that LPV/r or DRV + RTV were good options as a first regimen. Prognosis was determined by the impact of initial treatment on baseline CD4+ T-cell count and viral load, adherence, virological suppression/failure/rebound, acquired resistance mutations, and ensuing treatment changes. Inputs were taken from trial data (ARTEMIS), literature and, where necessary, stated assumptions. Clinical measures included AIDS events, side effects, time on sequential therapies, cardiovascular events, and expected life-years lost as a result of HIV infection. The model underwent face, technical and partial predictive validation. Treatment-naive individuals similar to those in the ARTEMIS trial were modelled over a lifetime, and outcomes with first-line DRV + RTV were compared with those with LPV/r, both paired with tenofovir and emtricitabine. Up to three regimen changes were permitted. Drug prices were based on wholesale acquisition cost. Outcomes were lifetime healthcare costs (in 2011 US dollars) from the US healthcare system perspective and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (discounted at 3 % per annum). Results Choice of LPV/r over DRV + RTV as initial ART resulted in nearly identical clinical outcomes, but distinctly different economic consequences. Starting with an LPV/r regimen potentially results in approximately US$25,000 discounted lifetime savings. Accumulated QALYs for LPV/r and DRV + RTV were 12.130 and 12.083, respectively (a 19-day difference). In sensitivity analyses, net monetary benefit ranged from US$12,000 to US$31,000, favouring LPV/r (base case US$27,762). Conclusions A comprehensive simulation of lifetime course of HIV in the USA indicated that using LPV/r as first-line therapy compared with DRV + RTV may result in cost savings, with similar clinical outcomes."

To this end, we develop an agent-based model in which alternative learning schemes can be compared in terms of the consumption behavior that they yield. We show that neither purely adaptive learning nor social learning based on imitation can ensure satisfactory consumption behavior. In contrast, if the agents can form adaptive expectations, based on an evolving individual mental model, their behavior becomes much more interesting in terms of its regularity and its ability to improve performance (which is a clear manifestation of learning). Our results indicate that assumptions on bounded rationality and on adaptive expectations are perfectly compatible with sound and realistic economic behavior, which, in some cases, can even converge to the optimal solution. This framework may therefore be used to develop macroeconomic models with adaptive dynamics."

Currently, there are many input/output modes of capturing construction knowledge related to all construction stages. On the other hand, building information modelling (BIM) systems have been developed to help in storing various structured data of buildings. However, these systems cannot fully capture the knowledge and unstructured data used in the operation of building systems in a usable format that uses the intelligent capabilities of BIM systems. Therefore, this research aims to adopt the concept of big data and develop a spoken dialogue BIM system to capture buildings operation knowledge, particularly for building maintenance and refurbishment. Design/methodology/approach The proposed system integrates cloud-based spoken dialogue system and case-based reasoning BIM system. Findings The system acts as an interactive expert agent that seeks answers from the user for questions specific to building maintenance problems and helps searching for solutions from previously stored knowledge cases. The practices of monitoring and maintaining buildings performance can be more efficient by the retrieval of relevant solutions from the captured knowledge to new problems when maintaining buildings components. The developed system enables easier capture and search for solutions to new problems with a more comprehensive retrieval of information. Originality/value Capturing multi-modes data into BIM systems using the cloud-based spoken dialogue systems will help construction teams use the high volume of data generated over building lifecycle and search for the most suitable solutions for maintenance problems. This new area of research also contributes to the current BIM systems by advancing their capabilities to instantly capture and retrieve knowledge of operations instead of only information."

Given the reciprocal effects between L2 testing and L2 learning, a research effort in monitoring working in speaking tests, in particular computer-delivered integrated speaking tests, a testing format that has been advocated as an internal part of L2 classroom instruction and represents the future direction of L2 testing, is warranted. This study, therefore, serves as such an effort through investigating the use of monitoring by 95 Chinese English as foreign language (EFL) learners on a self-reported questionnaire after they performed three computer-delivered integrated speaking test tasks. Descriptive analysis followed by Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) testing reveals that monitoring was used in a high-frequency manner, but it exerted no substantial effects on learner performance. Primarily, the results are expected to provide pedagogical implications for SRL: while fostering self-regulating learners, especially self-monitoring L2 speakers, it is necessary for L2 teachers to purposefully reduplicate testing conditions in their classroom instructions for helping the self-regulating learners be equally self-regulating test-takers. Moreover, the results are hoped to offer some insights into L2 testing through the perspective of self-monitoring, one proposed component of strategic competence, a construct that has been extensively acknowledged to reflect the essence of L2 testing."

DealBrian2003Sdma,,Spatial dynamic modeling and urban land use transformation : an ecological simulation approach to assessing the costs of urban sprawl,"Deal, Brian and Schunk, Daniel",2003,,,,,,,,Mannheim,"Assessing the economic impacts of urban land use transformation has become complex and acrimonious. Although community planners are beginning to comprehend the economic trade-offs inherent in transforming the urban fringe, they find it increasingly difficult to analyze and assess the trade-offs expediently and in ways that can influence local decisionmaking. New and sophisticated spatial modeling techniques are now being applied to urban systems that can quickly assess the probable spatial outcomes of given communal policies. Applying an economic impact assessment to the probable spatial patterns can provide to planners the tools needed to quickly assess scenarios for policy formation that will ultimately help inform decision makers. This paper focuses on the theoretical underpinnings and practical application of an economic impact analysis submodel developed within the Land use Evolution and Impact Assessment Modeling (LEAM) environment. The conceptual framework of LEAM is described, followed by an application of the model to the assessment of the cost of urban sprawl in Kane County, Illinois. The results show the effectiveness of spatially explicit modeling from a theoretical and a practical point of view. The agent-based approach of spatial dynamic modeling with a high spatial resolution allows for discerning the macro-level implications of micro-level behaviors. These phenomena are highlighted in the economic submodel in the discussion of the implications of land use change decisions on individual and communal costs; low-density development patterns favoring individual behaviors at the expense of the broader community."

We explore how this insight extends to the variability of payments to suppliers and its impact on how risk is generated and propagates upstream. To do so, we model the financial features of a supply chain based on industry reports and empirical findings from the finance literature. Capturing policies and constraints of the agents in the supply chain in a formal model, we are able to generate and explain the behavior observed in real supply chains. We show that payment variability occurs and propagates, even if orders are constant, in a cash-constrained supply chain. Furthermore, our model reveals that payment variability may even become amplified under severe cash restrictions. We identify the factors that drive the propagation of variability—the industry risk, the firm's operational leverage, the existence of a financial leverage target, and the cost of debt. The model also makes it possible to explore states of nature not often observed in practice, but that may have an effect in managers' behavior, for example, bankruptcies. We numerically illustrate the impact of these drivers on the risk of upper echelons (suppliers and suppliers' suppliers) as well as the interactions between order and payment variability. We close by summarizing our findings and discussing future research opportunities."

Thus, the aim of this paper is to test the impact of the five activities of financial knowledge brokers (i.e., financial knowledge acquisition, financial knowledge integration, financial knowledge adaptation, financial knowledge dissemination, and creation of links) on financial literacy. For this, we built a database from a questionnaire carried out to nearly 103 financial advisers during the period June 2015 to June 2017. Overall, the results of Structural equation Modeling (SEM) technique showed that the financial knowledge brokerage activities (four of the five activities) have a positive impact on improving financial literacy as well as on its four dimensions, namely financial attitude, financial behavior, basic financial knowledge, and advanced financial knowledge."

Such a new level of efficiency involves their distributed facilities and offices spread around the world, and their customers. One consequence of this new reality is that forest products companies are now facing the need to re-engineer their organizational processes and business practices with their partners. To do this they must adopt new technologies to support the coordination of their planning and control efforts in a customer-centered environment. This paper first proposes a generic software architecture for development of an experimentation environment to design and test distributed advanced planning and scheduling systems. This architecture enables combination of agent-based technology and operations research-based tools in order to first take advantage of the ability of agent technology to integrate distributed decision problems, and, second, to take advantage of the ability of operations research to develop and exploit specific normative decision models. Next, this paper describes how this architecture has been configured into an advanced planning and scheduling tool for the lumber industry. Finally, we present how an application of this advanced planning tool is currently being validated and tested in a real manufacturing setting."

Using derivative financial instruments (including options) becomes important for hedging against uncertainty and managing risk-limiting exposure to adverse market conditions. Black and Scholes' equation is often used to value options, but its validity is questionable due to assumptions that may not hold for electricity, most notably the assumption of log-normally distributed prices for the underlying commodity. In this research, a put options market for electricity is modeled. Adaptive agents trade in this market to maximize profit. They are not forced to use an explicit economic or financial model (e.g., Black-Scholes) in their valuation. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find alternate valuations that are used to generate buy and sell signals. The results show that it is possible to evolve profitable valuations for use with buying and selling options in this simple model. Reasons for and implications of this finding (e.g., that Black-Scholes may not be a good method for pricing electricity derivatives) are discussed."

However, even if debt is a recurring topic in discussions about the current economic situation, economic modeling does not take into account debt as one of the crucial determinants of economic dynamics. The authors' contribution, in this paper, is to investigate the issues of borrowing and debt load by means of computational experiments, performed in the environment of the agent-based Eurace simulator. The authors aim to shed some light on the relation between debt and main economic indicators. Their results clearly confirm that the amount of credit in the economy is a very important variable, which can affect economic performance in a twofold way: fostering growth or pushing the economy into recession or crisis. The outcomes of their computational experiments show a rich scenario of interactions between real and financial variables in the economy, and therefore represent a truly innovative tool for the study of economics.

Nowadays, there are a great number of studies about home energy management systems (HEMSs) and centralised control. However, the former has the problem of producing new peaks and valley when incentives are applied, and the latter only focuses on overall economic benefits and ignores individual preferences. Therefore, the authors take an emerging decentralised solution, i.e. peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing mechanism, into consideration and then propose an autonomous energy community model. In this P2P autonomous energy community, participants form an alliance and can trade energy with each other to maximisation individual benefit without a central controller. To allocate profit fairly among members, an energy contract based on Shapley values is proposed. Modelling of participants, implementation of energy contract and operation principle of community is presented in this study. Finally, case studies are conducted with the comparison of the model where households apply HEMS independently. The results show that the proposed model yields reduction in electricity cost and it is also friendly to the power grid with lower energy fluctuation compared with the counterpart."

Some ARTs increase risk of these events. The purpose of this study was to examine patients' perspectives of these risks and estimate health state utilities associated with these risks for use in cost-utility models. Methods Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to examine messages posted to the POZ/AIDSmeds Internet community forums, focusing on bone, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects and risks of HIV/AIDS medications. Then, health state vignettes were drafted based on this qualitative analysis, literature review, and clinician interviews. The health states (representing HIV, plus treatmentrelated risks) were valued in time trade-off interviews with general population participants in the UK. Results Qualitative analysis of the Internet forums documented patient concerns about ART risks, as well as treatment decisions made because of these risks. A total of 208 participants completed utility interviews (51.4% female; mean age 44.6 years). The mean utility of the HIV health state (virologically suppressed, treated with ART) was 0.86. Adding a description of risk resulted in statistically significant disutility (i.e., utility decreases): renal risk (disutility =–0.02), bone risk (–0.03), and myocardial infarction risk (–0.05). Conclusions Patient concerns and treatment decisions were documented via qualitative analysis of Internet forum discussions, and the impact of these concerns was quantified in terms of health state utilities. The resulting disutilities may be useful for differentiating among ARTs in economic modeling of treatment for patients with HIV."

The system integrates four analytical tools: (i) geographic information system; (ii) system dynamics simulation; (iii) agent-based model; and (iv) hydrologic simulation. The choice of tools is driven by their ability to (a) respond to the main requirements of the IWRM and (b) explicitly describe system behaviour as function of time and location in space. The system dynamics simulation captures temporal dynamics in an integrated feedback model that includes sectors representing physical and socioeconomic system components. Management policies established in the participatory decision making environment are easily investigated through the simulation of system behaviour. Agent-based model is used to analyze spatial dynamics of complex physical-social-economic-biologic system. The IWRM support system is tested using data from the Upper Thames River Watershed, Ontario, Canada, in collaboration with the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority."

The book describes the theoretical foundations of evolutionary and institutional economics. Wolfram Elsner was introduced to the Association for Evolutionary Economics (AFEE) and the Association for Social Economics (ASE), associations with which he was going to uphold a close connection during his entire career. The book discusses the trade-offs that emerge in policy decisions when analyzed from an evolutionary and institutionalist perspective. It shows normative questions arising from evolutionary and institutional policy approaches which they integrate into their research program of evolutionary political economy. The book presents an analysis of the social fabric matrix approach in relation to agent-based modeling, complexity economics, and original institutional economics. It discusses the challenges and chances of an institutionalist guidance of economic policy. The book also discusses industrial policy from the perspective of the enduring tension between individual and societal objectives."

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer’s submission to NICE. Clinical evidence was derived from a multinational randomized open-label phase III trial of cabazitaxel plus prednisone or prednisolone in men with mHRPC that had progressed during or following treatment with docetaxel. The comparator was mitoxantrone plus prednisone or prednisolone. Use of cabazitaxel was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, median progression-free survival and time to tumour progression. However, it was also associated with an increased incidence of adverse events such as neutropenia. Utility data were based on interim results from the early access programme for cabazitaxel. Data were only available for a small number of patients with stable disease, resulting in great uncertainty as to the effect of cabazitaxel on quality of life. For their economic evaluation, the manufacturer estimated that the use of cabazitaxel was associated with an incremental cost of £74,908 per QALY gained. However, the ERG disagreed with the manufacturer over two key methodological points. The first concerned modelling and extrapolating survival; the second point was concerned with the choice of patient population. The ERG altered the manufacturer’s evaluation to take into account these two points of disagreement. The resulting cost per QALY gained was £82,950. The NICE Appraisal Committee believed the analysis presented by the ERG to be more plausible, and likely to be an underestimate of the cost per QALY. They concluded that whilst the clinical effectiveness of cabazitaxel had been proven, it was not likely to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources and so its use could not be recommended."

This paper investigates the methods for mitigating bankruptcy propagation through supply chain coordination. Based on a two-stage supply chain network that consists of multiple upstream manufacturers and multiple downstream retailers, the effectiveness of some typical contractual incentive schemes, including revenue sharing, price discount and quantity flexibility contracts, in mitigating bankruptcy propagation among supply chain members is examined. Through agent-based simulation experiments, it has been revealed that: 1) the three typical supply chain contracts with properly designed contract parameters are effective in mitigating bankruptcy propagation, but their effectiveness depends on operational parameters of the supply chain; 2) horizontal competition among retailers is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of these contracts; 3) revenue sharing contract turns out to be more effective in mitigating bankruptcy propagation than the other two contracts. By comparing the optimal contract parameters with and without considering bankruptcy risks, it has also been found that, a set of contract parameters that can maximize the profit of the supply chain may increase the occurrence of bankruptcy in supply chain, leading to the phenomenon of a risk–profit tradeoff. ► The effectiveness of each contract depends on parameters of supply chain. ► Retail competition is an important factor in determining a contract's effectiveness. ► When retail competition is mild, revenue sharing and price discount are effective. ► If competition is intensive, quantity flexibility and revenue sharing are effective. ► There is a tradeoff between profit-maximizing and reducing the risk of bankruptcy."

Therefore, there is a need to model real-world scenarios that involve a trade-off between self-interest and social welfare with minimal artificial assumptions or constraints in a versatile framework. In this paper, we build an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of a multi-agent, bilateral, resource-exchange network. We analyze how various strategies employed by communities can improve or hurt community payoffs as well as the overall social welfare of the network. We also analyze the role of common knowledge in inducing cooperation in the network. Our experimental evidence from simulations confirms that carefully-designed trading mechanisms can indeed encourage cooperation among communities with various motivations."

Identification of costs associated with different stages of untreated disease through cost-of-illness (COI) evaluation helps inform policy decisions and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). This study’s objective was to review published real-world costs for patients with HCV to estimate the COI across different stages of disease progression. Methods A literature search of EMBASE, Scopus, and PubMed from January 1, 2010 to August 31, 2019 was conducted to identify real-world evidence related to HCV. Data extraction included citation details, population, study type, costing method used, currency and inflation adjustments, and disease-specific costs. Standardized costing method categories (sum all medical, sum diagnosis specific, matching, regression, other incremental, and other total) were assigned. The risk of bias was assessed at the outcome level for influence on costs attributable to HCV. Results The search strategy identified 278 studies, with 31 included in the final review after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Retrospective cohorts (77%) and cross-sectional analyses (16%) were most frequently encountered. Sum Diagnosis Specific was the most common costing method (39%), followed by Regression (32%). Of the 31 studies analyzed, 35% included costs that would be included in a societal model. Costs were identified for various stages and complications related to HCV disease progression. Several studies included were determined to have a high (48%) or moderate risk (42%) of bias related to COI estimates. Conclusion Cost estimates for formal, informal, and non-health care services were identified in this review, but several challenges still exist in fully quantifying HCV burden. Future modeling studies including cost inputs should critically evaluate the risk of bias based on costing methods and data sources."

In particular, the paper argues that nurturing interaction with external agents (by means of participation in different events that allow face-to-face interaction, or via collaborative technology) positively affects the innovation capability of firms by allowing the development of innovation networks and making them run smoothly. Design/methodology/approach – For this to be tested, an analysis has been carried out in Uruguayan software firms. A questionnaire was designed and addressed to the managers of the firms making up the target population. Structural equation modeling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS) was then applied to test the hypotheses put forward by the research. Findings – The results obtained show that nurturing interaction with external agents has a positive and significant influence both on the formation of innovation networks and on their operational performance. This influence is much stronger when it comes to ensuring the smooth operation of the network than when it comes to facilitating its formation. Moreover, innovation networks and their functioning clearly mediate the relationship between interaction with external agents and innovation capability. Research limitations/implications – Traditional limitations of cross-sectional studies apply. Originality/value – Although previous literature highlights the relevance of social interaction for the creation of new knowledge and subsequent innovation, the role of mediating variables has been hardly considered. This research helps to shed some light on this issue in the case of social interaction with external agents. In particular, the mediating role of innovation networks has been analyzed."

This analysis evaluates the cost effectiveness of nebivolol compared with standard treatment. Methods: An individual patient-simulation model based on a Markov modelling framework was developed to compare costs and outcomes for nebivolol and standard care in patients with heart failure starting treatment at the age of 70 years. Health states were defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and death. At a given NYHA class and a given cycle, patients could die, be hospitalized for cardiovascular disease or remain stable. Risks for these events were derived from individual patient data from the SENIORS trial. The risk of each event in a given cycle was based on the subject’s baseline characteristics and time in the current health state. The economic analysis was conducted from the UK NHS perspective with a lifetime horizon. The costs (€; year 2006 values) considered were drug costs for nebivolol and other cardiac drugs, costs of GP visits, outpatient specialist visits and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results: In the baseline analysis, the total cost per patient was €6740 and €9288, and QALYs were 5.194 and 5.843 for patients aged 70 years at the start of treatment for the standard treatment and nebivolol groups, respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis provided an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €3926 (95% CI 3731, 4159) per QALY. Conclusions: This analysis indicates that nebivolol appears to be a cost-effective treatment for elderly patients with heart failure compared with standard care."

To overcome this inconsistency, two easily applicable risk aversion mechanisms are proposed which modify the original actions of a market maker and the speculative agents, respectively. Here the concepts are incorporated into the classical Beja–Goldman model. For the deterministic version of the thus enhanced model a four-dimensional mathematical stability analysis is provided. In a stochastic version it is demonstrated that jointly the mechanisms are indeed able to keep the agents’ positions within bounds, provided the corresponding risk aversion coefficients are neither too low nor too high. A similar result holds for the misalignment of the market price."

Health technology appraisals of future interventions in MND need robust data on costs and utilities. Existing economic evaluations have been noted to be limited and fraught with challenges. Objective The aim of this study was to identify and critique methodological aspects of all published economic evaluations, cost studies, and utility studies in MND. Methods We systematically reviewed all relevant published studies in English from 1946 until January 2016, searching the databases of Medline, EMBASE, Econlit, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Economics Evaluation Database (HEED). Key data were extracted and synthesised narratively. Results A total of 1830 articles were identified, of which 15 economic evaluations, 23 cost and 3 utility studies were included. Most economic studies focused on riluzole ( n = 9). Six studies modelled the progressive decline in motor function using a Markov design but did not include mutually exclusive health states. Cost estimates for a number of evaluations were based on expert opinion and were hampered by high variability and location-specific characteristics. Few cost studies reported disease-stage-specific costs ( n = 3) or fully captured indirect costs. Utilities in three studies of MND patients used the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire or standard gamble, but included potentially unrepresentative cohorts and did not consider any health impacts on caregivers. Conclusion Economic evaluations in MND suffer from significant methodological issues such as a lack of data, uncertainty with the disease course and use of inappropriate modelling framework. Limitations may be addressed through the collection of detailed and representative data from large cohorts of patients."

Customers who frequent these marketplaces seek quick resolutions and thus are usually willing to trade prices with waiting times. The main goal of this paper is to discuss the role of the moderating firm in facilitating information gathering, operational efficiency, and communication among agents in service marketplaces. Surprisingly, we show that operational efficiency may be detrimental to the overall efficiency of the marketplace. Furthermore, we establish that to reap the ""expected"" gains of operational efficiency, the moderating firm may need to complement the operational efficiency by enabling communication among its agents.

R",2003,Management science,49,2,160-178,,,INFORMS,LINTHICUM HTS,"This paper evaluates the relative performances of several wellknown and widelyused incentive mechanisms under controlled experimental conditions. The scenario utilized is a delegated investment setting where effort and risk aversions contribute to moral hazard among fund managers. Analytical intractability of the problem requires a computational modeling approach to simulate comparative solutions for specific contracts under different parametric settings. Through a simulation exercise, we consider multiple agents who decide their investment strategy over several consecutive periods. Agents learn about estimation and market uncertainty through repeated realizations of investment returns. In each sequence of periods, a number of different incentive mechanisms based on the agent's communication and/or outcome are considered. Results of the computational experiments are presented. Our results overwhelmingly show the efficacy of the incentive contracts in improving the welfare of the investors. In the presence of an estimation risk, when agents learn from their past performances, the market volatility interacts with the estimation risk that makes risksharing arrangements such as limited liability overly important. Paying the agent to assume the risk may no longer lead to the best performance incentives."

The core of modeling the interrelation between price, cost price and income is dividing all goods into those of final and intermediate consumption. The traditional macroeconomic hypotheses (equilibrium, SNA balances, influence of money supply, etc.) turned out to be particular cases. The model can be modified for any country.

Quit rates were obtained from Project ACTION (Adult smoking Cessation Treatment through Innovative Outreach to Neighborhoods). We evaluated shorter-term outcomes of cost per quit and long-term outcomes using cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).ResultsFor men, EC cost an additional $541 per quit vs SC; however, IC cost an additional $5232 per quit vs EC. For women, EC was weakly dominated by IC—IC cost an additional $1092 per quit vs SC.

JungJaewon2023TEoC,,The Effects of China's Participation in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP): A Quantitative Assessment,"Jung, Jaewon",2023,Sustainability,15,1,344-,,,Mdpi,BASEL,"This paper aims to quantify the effects of China's participation in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), in particular by focusing on the possible productivity effects through the endogenous assignment of skills to technologies. In this paper, we develop a large-scale global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model in which firms are heterogeneous in technologies and workers are heterogeneous in individual skill levels so that equilibrium skill-technology assignments are endogenously determined. This study contributes to the literature with the new CGE modeling and application to the recent important issue in international trade. By calibrating the model to 23 countries and regions, we quantify the effects of China's participation in the CPTPP. Due to the positive real productivity effects and the reallocation of workers, the results show that China's participation in the CPTPP may generate significantly higher productivity, GDP, and welfare effects compared to previous conventional CGE models based on simplistic representative agent frameworks at a given productivity. Globally, on average, the real productivity of the manufacturing sector, the number of exporting firms, real GDP, and welfare increase by 0.52%, 19.62%, 1.36%, and USD 3.41 billion, respectively."
CernohorskyPetr2012Voii,,Value of information in health services market,"Cernohorsky, Petr and Voracek, Jan",2012,Measuring business excellence,16,4,42-53,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,BINGLEY,"Purpose - The traditional service market is composed of customers and service providers, interacting within a given structure and following market-specific rules. These basic attributes are obvious and persistent. The fragile entity, which is essential for normally operating and self-controlling market, is information. In this context the aim is to distinguish between a background noise, arising from comprehensive marketing campaigns, customer care activities or advertisement and data, advices or knowledge, necessary for any focused business decision. The straightforward example of prospective market suffering from information shortage is healthcare. For a normal patient it is almost impossible to select purposely a better doctor, hospital or therapy. Even providers of care are not always sure about the exact diagnosis, resulting in the extended length of patient's stay and its related costs.Design methodology approach - From the knowledge engineering point of view, the national market of healthcare services is a platform where distributed micro behavior of patients interacts with centralized, systemic activities of medical care and insurance providers under the umbrella of governmental rules. Owing to the problem complexity, a significant portion of included subjectivity and natural heterogeneity of available knowledge, the authors have adopted a combined modeling platform as the most natural way of its formalization and processing. Typical groups of patients are represented as multi-state agents, adjusting reactions and preferences quickly in accordance with time, changing environment and quality of accessible information. Hospitals, on the contrary, are considered as system dynamic enterprises with domain-tailored processes both on operational and managerial levels.Findings - The first interesting outcome is the clear experimental evidence, justifying the impossibility of purely market-driven control and development of a national healthcare system. Furthermore, the paper presents a novelty heterogeneous model as a viable tool for analysis of emergent market behavior enabling evaluation of different public health policies.Practical implications - The developed model can serve both policy makers and hospital managers. To the former it can experimentally help to investigate the influence of parametric changes of overall market regulations. The latter can benefit especially from optimization of internal processes, leading both to performance and competitive advantage improvements. Moreover, due to its transparency and interactivity, the method of heterogeneous modeling is ideal for strategic planning, group decision making, capturing and sharing of organizational knowledge or organizational learning. Finally, the implementation flexibility and architectural scalability predetermines combined modeling as a convenient technique for rapid prototyping of complex problems.Originality value - This paper combines areas of health economics, enterprise management and computational economics in a challenging and innovative way. The value of the proposed research methods relies on the application of a heterogeneous paradigm in multiple perspectives - not only by combining the agent-based models with system dynamics approach, but also by combining and evaluating alternative approaches to representing agents' state and knowledge."

A critical need is to improve the relationship between farmers’ decisions and their impact on natural resources. One of the basic requirements that links buyers and sellers of ecosystem services is an agreed upon unit of trade and a way to measure it. We develop an agent-based model (ABM) which is designed to formalize the interactions between the biophysics dynamics of the natural resources and the socio-economic factors. The simulation market builds on ABM paradigms in its concepts and is coded using the Matlab programming environment. The result shows that ABM is contributing to research questions in ecological economics areas of land-use change, public auction modeling, market dynamics, changes in owners’ perceived yield potential, owners’ gold, farming choice and water treatment choice aspects in human decision making and behavior change."

The result of the collaboration should be an outcome that maximizes the utility of the system without excessively penalizing any of the agents. This paper describes the results of a tradeoff analysis between flight costs and sector throughput for combinations of ATCSCC and AOC strategies for flight-plan route selections in the presence of weather that affects enroute airspace capacity. The analysis is conducted using a discrete event simulation model of an airspace network with several airports, sectors and alternative airways. The results of the analysis indicate that when both Miles-in-Trails (MIT) restrictions for the airspace, as well as, TFM rerouting in collaboration with the AOC takes place, the performance of the overall system achieves a reduction of 67% in delay costs, 61% in delay time, 22% in delay rate and 69% in total passengers delay time (compared to the baseline).

ZarabieAhmadKhaled2019CLMa,,Consumer Load Modeling and Fair Mechanisms in the Efficient Transactive Energy Market,"Zarabie, Ahmad Khaled",2019,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Two significant and closely related issues pertaining to the grid-constrained transactive distribution system market are investigated in this research. At first, the problem of spatial fairness in the allocation of energy among energy consumers is addressed, where consumer agents that are located at large distances from the substation–in terms of grid layout, are charged at higher rates than those close to it. This phenomenon, arising from the grid’s voltage and flow limits is aggravated during demand peaks. Using the Jain’s index to quantify fairness, two auction mechanisms are proposed. Both approaches are bilevel, with aggregators acting as interface agents between the consumers and the upstream distribution system operator (DSO). Furthermore, in spite of maximizing social welfare, neither mechanism makes use of the agents’ utility functions. The first mechanism is cost-setting, with the DSO determining unit costs. It implements the Jain’s index as a second term to the social welfare. Next, a power setting auction mechanism is put forth where the DSO’s role is to allocate energy in response to market equilibrium unit costs established at each aggregator from an iterative bidding process among its consumers. The Augmented Lagrangian Multigradient Approach (ALMA), which is based on vector gradient descent, is proposed in this research for implementation at the upper level. The mechanism’s lower level comprises of multiple auctions realized by the aggregators. The quasi-concavity of the Jain’s index is theoretically established, and it has been shown that ALMA converges to the Pareto front representing tradeoffs between social welfare and fairness. The effectiveness of both mechanisms is established through simulations carried out using a modified IEEE 37-bus system platform.The issue of extracting patterns of energy usage from time series energy use profiles of individual consumers is the focus of the second phase of this research. Two novel approaches for non-intrusive load disaggregation based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), are proposed. Both algorithms distinguish between fixed and shiftable load classes, with the latter being characterized by binary OFF and ON cycles. Fixed loads are represented as linear combinations of a set of basis vectors that are learned by NMF. One approach imposes L0 normed constraints on each shiftable load using a new method called binary load decomposition. The other approach models shiftable loads as Gaussian mixture models (GMM), therefore using expectation-maximization for unsupervised learning. This hybrid NMF-GMM algorithm enjoys the theoretical advantage of being interpretable as a maximum-likelihood procedure within a probabilistic framework. Numerical studies with real load profiles demonstrate that both algorithms can effectively disaggregate total loads into energy used by individual appliances. Using disaggregated loads, a maximum-margin regression approach to derive more elaborate, temperature-dependent utility functions of the consumers, is proposed. The research concludes by identifying the various ways gleaning such information can lead to more effective auction mechanisms for multi-period operation."

This paper aims to focus on economic and social impacts on the technologies of climate engineering themselves. However, very few research concentrates on the management of climate engineering. Furthermore, scientific knowledge and a unified system of CEM are limited. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the concept of CEM and its characteristics are proposed and elaborated. In addition, the framework of CEM is established based on management objectives, management processes and supporting theory and technology of management. Moreover, a multi-agent synergistic theory of CEM is put forward to guide efficient management of climate engineering, which is composed of time synergy, space synergy, and factor synergy. This theory is suitable for solving all problems encountered in the management of various climate engineering rather than a specific climate engineering. Specifically, the proposed CEM system aims to mitigate the impact of climate change via refining and summarizing the interrelationship of each component. Findings Overall, the six research frontiers and hotspots in the field of CEM are explored based on the current status of research. Originality/value In terms of the objectives listed above, this paper seeks to provide a reference for formulating the standards and norms in the management of various climate engineering, as well as contribute to policy implementation and efficient management."

Urban areas often face versatile stressors (e.g., food security, congestion, energy shortage, water pollution, water scarcity, waste management, and storm and flooding), requiring better resilient and sustainable infrastructure systems. A system dynamics model (SDM), explored for the urban region of Orlando, Florida, acts as a multi-agent model for portraying material and energy flows across the food, energy, water, and waste (FEWW) sectors to account for urban sustainability transitions. The interlinkages between the FEWW sectors in the SDM are formulated with multiple layers of dependencies and interconnections of the available resources and their external climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic drivers through four case studies (scenarios). The vital components in the integrated FEWW infrastructure system include urban agriculture associated with the East End Market Urban Farm; energy from the fuel-diverse Curtis H. Stanton Energy Center; reclaimed wastewater treated by the Eastern Water Reclamation Facility, the Water Conserv II Water Reclamation Facility, and stormwater reuse; and solid waste management and biogas generation from the Orange County Landfill. The four scenarios evaluated climate change impacts, policy instruments, and land use teleconnection for waste management in the FEWW nexus, demonstrating regional synergies among these components. The use of multicriteria decision-making coupled with cost-benefit-risk tradeoff analysis supported the selection of case 4 as the most appropriate option as it provided greater renewable energy production and stormwater reuse. The SDM graphic user interface aids in the visualization of the dynamics of the FEWW nexus framework, demonstrating the specific role of renewable energy harvesting for sustainably transitioning Orlando into a circular economy.

LaiGuoming2006Emnw,,Efficient multi-attribute negotiation with incomplete information,"Lai, Guoming and Li, Cuihong and Sycara, Katia",2006,Group decision and negotiation,15,5,511-528,,,Springer Nature,DORDRECHT,"Multi-attribute negotiation is an important mechanism for distributed decision makers to reach agreements in real-world situations. It allows the possibility of reaching ""win-win"" solutions for both parties, who trade off different attributes in a solution. Existing research on multi-attribute negotiations has mainly focused on the situations when negotiation parties have complete information about each other's preference. This paper presents a model with incomplete information, while considering Pareto-efficiency and computational efficiency. A non-biased mediator, who applies query learning to maintain near Pareto-efficiency without heavy computation, is adopted in the model. In addition, the mediating mechanism proposed in the model overcomes the difficulty of preference elicitation which usually arises in the preliminary step of a multi-attribute negotiation. Our model also reduces the negotiation complexity by decomposing the original n-dimensional negotiation space into a sequence of negotiation base lines. Agents can negotiate upon a base line with rather simple strategies. The experimental results show that near Pareto-efficient agreements can be reached effectively."

This type of simulation allows the combination of several agents, factors of production and different regions, providing very detailed information at the macroeconomic and microeconomic level with the possibility of applying different assumptions that allow different results to be obtained. The ""Association Agreement"" between the European Union and Mercosur is an agreement that, due to its scope and size of the economies of the blocks that comprise them, is one of the largest ever reached by both, and was signed in 2019 after 20 years of negotiations. The European Union's trade policy tends towards a liberalization that transcends the purely commercial aspect and expands towards aspects related to sustainability and respect for human rights. Mercosur (made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) is an imperfect customs union whose main economic drive is based on trade in its internal market, and having reached a comprehensive agreement with the EU presents an opportunity to liberalize not only its trade in goods, but also in services, including aspects such as foreign direct investment (FDI) and public procurement, the latter being of special interest because it is hermetic and does not allow foreign companies to compete in its internal market to provide goods and services in the public sector. This gradual liberalization, with certain exceptions that the agreement allows, is attractive to EU companies that want to expand their operations in a huge market. This analysis, however, will focus exclusively on the impact of the agreement on Brazil through a Computable General Equilibrium Model (CGE). Brazil represents approximately ¾ of Mercosur's GDP, so the impact on this member state would largely affect the rest of the trade block."

The effect of thermoultrasound treatment on the survival of V. parahaemolyticus in raw peeled shrimps was investigated in this study as an alternative bacterial inactivation method in seafood as part of the postharvest washing process. Raw peeled shrimps inoculated with V. parahaemolyticus were treated with mild heat (47, 50, and 53 degrees C) combined with ultrasound (0, 96, 150, and 204 W) based on a 3 x 4 full factorial design, and the bacterial survival curves were fitted with a Weibull model. Because of the high correlations of the shape parameter n and the scale parameter beta in the Weibull model, an overall n was estimated from the whole set of bacterial inactivation data and beta values were estimated for each set of inactivation curves accordingly. A response surface model was generated to describe the scale parameter as a function of temperature and ultrasonic power. The results indicated that the Weibull model with the overall n value could be used to describe the bacterial reduction with the time of exposure to the thermoultrasound treatments, which was well supported by the small root mean square errors (RMSE) and the high coefficients of determination (R-2). The quadratic model was validated with independent experiments within the prediction range. Statistical indices (R-2 = 0.99; P < 0.0001; RMSE = 0.17) and validation parameters (bias factor = 0.97; accuracy factor = 1.03) indicated satisfactory performance of the quadratic model. The results indicated that the thermoultrasound treatment is effective, simple, and cost-effective for inactivation of V. parahaemolyticus in shrimps during the postharvest washing process."

In an artificial stock market, we consider two broad types of agents, “rational traders” and “imitators”. Rational traders trade to optimize their short-term profit and imitators invest based on the trend follow strategy. We examine how the coexistence of rational and irrational traders affect stock prices and their long run performance. We show the performances of these traders depend on their ratio in the market. In the region where rational traders are in the minority, they can come to win the market, in that they eventually have a high share of wealth. On the other hand, in the region where rational traders are in the majority, imitators can come to win the market. We conclude that the survival in a finance market is a kind of the minority game, and mimic traders (noise traders) might survive and come to win."

SharmaDheeraj2009Icap,,Internet channel and perceived cannibalization Scale development and validation in a personal selling context,"Sharma, Dheeraj and Gassenheimer, Jule B.",2009,European journal of marketing,43,8-Jul,1076-1091,,,Emerald Group Publishing,BINGLEY,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is multifold. First, this study aims to proffer a psychometric scale to measure sales agent's perception of sales cannibalization due to the addition of an internet channel. Second, the study seeks to estimate the downstream impact of sales agents' perceived cannibalization (SPC) on two outcomes, namely, commitment and alienation from work. Third, it aims to examine the moderating role of environmental munificence in the relationship between SPC and the two outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The data for this study were collected from a contact pool of 2,108 insurance sales agents. A total of 511 valid responses were attained. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the relationships posited in this study. Findings - First, a multi-item scale was conceptualized and developed for measuring SPC. Second, the properties of the scale were assessed following procedures recommended by Churchill, Anderson, Gerbing, Bagozzi, and Yi. The scale demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity. Third, SPC was shown to be not universally damaging to commitment. Rather, only under a low munificent environment does perceived cannibalization significantly reduce salespersons' commitment. Additionally, the severity of the influence of SPC on alienation from work increases in low munificent environment. Research limitations/implications - The data for this study were collected using a single survey of insurance agents. Future researchers should attempt to examine the relationships posited in this study using a sample from a different industry. Practical implications - While recognizing that the internet is here to stay and that strategic channel decisions will unlikely be made based on the views or psychological reactions of sales agents alone, incorporating the sales agent perspective does allow organizations to take a holistic view of their distribution system. This may be particularly important in view of multi-channel marketing, when a new marketing channel is employed to co-exist with the traditional sales force. Originality/value - Previous conceptualizations of inter-channel cannibalization were all based on economic terms and, hence, were considered myopic by Porter. This study examines the psychological influence of the addition of an internet channel on sale agents' work related outcomes."

Part C, Emerging technologies",163,,104659-,,,Elsevier Ltd,OXFORD,"Predicting the trajectories of road agents is fundamental for self-driving cars. Trajectory prediction contains many sources of uncertainty in data and modelling. A thorough understanding of this uncertainty is crucial in a safety-critical task like auto-piloting a vehicle. In practice, it is necessary to distinguish between the uncertainty caused by partial observability of all factors that may affect a driver’s near-future decisions, the so-called aleatoric uncertainty, and the uncertainty of deploying a model in new scenarios that are possibly not present in the training set, the so-called epistemic uncertainty. They reflect the trade-off between data collection and model improvement In this paper, we propose a new framework to systematically quantify both sources of uncertainty. Specifically, to approximate the spatial distribution of an agent’s future position, we propose a 2D histogram-based deep learning model combined with deep ensemble techniques for measuring aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by entropy-based quantities. The proposed Uncertainty Quantification Network (UQnet) employs a causal part to enhance its generalizability so rare driving behaviours can be effectively identified. Experiments on the INTERACTION dataset show that UQnet is able to give more robust predictions in generalizability tests compared to the correlation-based models. Further analysis presents that high aleatoric uncertainty cases are mainly caused by heterogeneous driving behaviours and unknown intended directions. Based on this aleatoric uncertainty component, we estimate the lower bounds of mean-square-error and final-displacement-error as indicators for the predictability of trajectories. Furthermore, the analysis of epistemic uncertainty illustrates that domain knowledge of speed-dependent driving behaviour is essential for adapting a model from low-speed to high-speed situations. Our paper contributes to motion forecasting with a new framework, that recasts the problem of accuracy improvement in a way that focuses on differentiating between unpredictable components and rare cases for which more and different data should be collected. •Propose a deep-ensemble-based non-parametric approach for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in single-agent trajectory prediction.•Induce a causal regularization to enhance the generalizability and give reliable estimates of epistemic uncertainty.•Give insights into the role of speed in epistemic uncertainty estimation and model generalization for trajectory forecasting."
InouaSabiouM2020Neav,,News-driven expectations and volatility clustering,"Inoua, Sabiou M",2020,Journal of risk and financial management,13,1,14-Jan,,,MDPI,Basel,"Financial volatility obeys two fascinating empirical regularities that apply to various assets, on various markets, and on various time scales: it is fat-tailed (more precisely power-law distributed) and it tends to be clustered in time. Many interesting models have been proposed to account for these regularities, notably agent-based models, which mimic the two empirical laws through a complex mix of nonlinear mechanisms such as traders switching between trading strategies in highly nonlinear way. This paper explains the two regularities simply in terms of traders' attitudes towards news, an explanation that follows from the very traditional dichotomy of financial market participants, investors versus speculators, whose behaviors are reduced to their simplest forms. Long-run investors' valuations of an asset are assumed to follow a news-driven random walk, thus capturing the investors' persistent, long memory of fundamental news. Short-term speculators' anticipated returns, on the other hand, are assumed to follow a news-driven autoregressive process, capturing their shorter memory of fundamental news, and, by the same token, the feedback intrinsic to the short-sighted, trend-following (or herding) mindset of speculators. These simple, linear models of traders' expectations explain the two financial regularities in a generic and robust way. Rational expectations, the dominant model of traders' expectations, is not assumed here, owing to the famous no-speculation, no-trade results."

On the basis of knowledge induced from literature, a generic conceptual framework for hybrid simulation has been developed. The proposed framework is demonstrated using an explanatory case study comprising an accident and emergency (A&E) department.Findings - The framework provided detailed guidance for the development of a hybrid model of an A&E case study. Findings of this case study suggest that the hybrid model was more efficient in capturing behavioural impact on operational performances.Research limitations implications - The framework is limited to only SD and DES; as agent-based is another simulation method which is emerging as a promising tool for analysing problems such as spread of infectious diseases in healthcare context, inclusion of this into the framework will enhance the utility of the framework.Practical implications - This framework will aid in the development of hybrid models capable of comprehending both detail as well as dynamic complexity, which will contribute towards a deeper understanding of the problems, resulting in more effective decision making.Social implications - It is expected that this research will encourage those engaged in simulation (e.g. researchers, practitioners, decision makers) to realise the potential of cross-fertilisation of the two simulation paradigms.Originality value - Currently, there is no conceptual framework which provides guidance for developing hybrid models. In order to address this gap, this paper contributes by proposing a conceptual framework for hybrid simulation for the healthcare domain."

A deadlock may arise in which both negotiators refuse to disclose more information; then, mediation is required. We propose an agent-based sealed-bid design in which both agents simultaneously submit their respective offers to the mediate agent, and construct an efficient negotiation strategy which can reach an agreement aiming to maximize their owner’s utility. An important contribution of this paper is that we consider negotiators not necessarily to conflict over all issues, such as quantity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed automated negotiation strategy is efficient in terms of the Pareto-efficiency of the negotiated contracts, the joint utility obtained, and the equality of both agents. In addition, since disclosure of information is reduced greatly, the design can discourage counter-speculation and effectively control fraud and misrepresentation to a certain extent. The method we proposed is simple and stable in the context of a game and the model could be well suited for practical agent applications."

Despite great advances in cancer therapies, many of these patients develop non-curable metastases. The objective of cancer treatment in the metastatic setting is mainly to control symptoms and to prolong survival. The selection of the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen is affected by performance status, tumour biology, site and extent of the disease and the exposure to prior therapies. Recent developments in new kinds of cancer drugs have contributed not only to immense progress in clinical outcomes but also to dramatically increased treatment-related health costs. Costeffectiveness analysis is a type of economic evaluation that compares costs and health outcomes of alternative intervention strategies in a systematic way. In this review, a systematic literature search was performed and the evidence on the cost effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy for metastatic breast cancer was explored. Cost-effectiveness/-utility analysis of treatment regimens for metastatic breast cancer were identified using literature and reference searches (MEDLINE). Published reports on conventional and targeted cancer therapies were scrutinized and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were abstracted. Furthermore, the quality of reporting, as well as methodological and modeling issues, were extensively discussed. From full-text article reviews, six cost-effectiveness analyses on conventional therapies and seven studies on targeted therapies were included. Eight analyses were conducted in European countries, three in the US and two in Canada. The economic models were primarily (69%) based on clinical trial data. Results from sensitivity analyses and study perspectives were reported by all studies. Discount rates were mentioned in five articles (39%). The methods of reporting costs and effects varied considerably, as did trial design across conventional chemotherapies, which made it difficult to compare those analyses. The pharmacoeconomic studies came to different conclusions. The actual clinical evidence does not suggest one conventional chemotherapy regimen as superior. Studies on cytotoxic agents showed mainly favourable costeffectiveness ratios. Targeted therapies indicated both favourable and nonfavourable ratios. Currently, trastuzumab is the only antibody-based targeted therapy that is established in the clinic for the metastatic setting."

The drastic changes and uncertainty in the environment had forced various industries to evolve effectively to cope with the unexpected change and subsequently bounce back to regain business success. For instance, private higher learning institutions face steep challenges due to the shortfall of organisational capabilities. The study aims to examine the role of leadership capabilities and organisational resilience in regaining organisational success among higher private learning institutions in Malaysia.Design/methodology/approachAccording to the dynamic capabilities theory, organisational resilience and leadership capabilities are among the highest order of indicators for organisational success. Subsequently, this study examines the mediating role of leadership capabilities on the relationship between organisational resilience on organisational performance. The dynamic capabilities-based framework was tested using the structural equation modelling technique with the use of partial least squares approach. Data were analysed using 120 responses.FindingsBased on the 120-questionnaire survey received, this study found that organisational resilience and leadership capabilities contribute significantly to the performance of private higher learning institutions. In addition, this study found strong support for the mediating role of leadership capabilities to promote performance. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications for post-disaster organisation resilience development.Research limitations/implicationsThe work focuses on values that would have an impact towards organisational performance, which is an important factor of survival in an unpredictable environment. The findings are limited by the indicated constraints used in this study.Practical implicationsOrganisational survival techniques would provide managers, owners and leaders effective techniques that can be implemented to extend and improve the organisation's life cycle. The focus on organisational resilience and leadership factors would greatly improve the overall sustainability and performance of the organisation.Originality/valueThe study contributed by showing the importance, use and interaction needed from organisational resilience and leadership capabilities for them to survive when there is a sudden change in the environment. The timing and uniqueness of the data during the pandemic illustrates how organisations can survive with high levels of weightage towards resilience and leadership. This research is different from other studies as it had examined the impact of values and resilience and leadership in organisations."

Model setup is based on new Keynesian framework, characterised by nominal rigidity in prices with habit formation in household's consumption. The core objective is to study whether an estimated small open economy DSGE model provides a realistic behavior about the structure Pakistan economy with fully articulated description of the monetary policy transmission mechanism vis-à-vis domestic firm's price setting behavior. To do so, we analyse the impulse responses of key macro variables; domestic inflation, imported inflation, output, consumption, interest rate, exchange rate, term of trade to different structural/exogenous shocks. From several interesting results, few are; (a) high inflation in Pakistan do not hit domestic consumption significantly; (b) Central bank of Pakistan responds to high inflation by increasing the policy rate by 100 to 200 bps; (c) exchange rate appreciates in both the cases of high domestic and imported inflation; (d) tight monetary policy stance helps to curb domestic inflation as well as imported inflation but appreciates exchange rate significantly (f) pass through of exchange rate to domestic inflation is very low; finally parameter value of domestic price stickiness shows that around 24 percent domestic firms do not re-optimise their prices which implies averaged price contract is about two quarters."

To this end, this thesis is organized into three essays. The …first essay discusses market manipulation. In particular, it first focuses on its central role when interpreting phenomena of strong persistent mispricing in specific …financial markets and finds minimal conditions for this market abuse to be sustainable over time. Then a taxonomy of market manipulation is presented, and simple examples provided. While different market structures and regulations are taken into account, informational asymmetry is proposed as the common ingredient in any manipulative behavior. Finally, the theory is synthesized, focusing on strategic agent-based modeling. The second essay proposes a unifi…ed theory of market non-anonymity in a model of strategic trading. Large …financial markets with either mandatory or voluntary public disclosure of trades are considered. The analysis considers whether extra displayed information is used by a possibly informed trader to manipulate others' beliefs. It is demonstrated that disclosures in some instances might be informative and in particular, when voluntary, they are always undertaken. Important price behaviour and (sometimes manipulative) trading strategies are identified. Policy implications are drawn, and regulatory interventions to enhance price efficiency and simultaneously prevent market abuses are scrutinized. The third essay provides a model of strategic trading in the single-dealer market, with an informed dealer standing ready to buy and sell a risky asset at her public bid and ask quotes. First, uninformed liquidity traders are considered. Then, a group of informed speculators is introduced. In contrast to other models, it can well be that the asset value lies outside the equilibrium price spread."

The main objective of this research is to regulate this role when in a project and to define and develop a building agent structure, according to the Building Standards Act (LOE by its acronym in Spanish), to be able to incorporate it into the Spanish law, protecting it from civil liabilities. In Spain, there is jurisprudence in civil jurisdiction based on the LOE to acquit or convict building agents, who are defined in the courts as “constructive managers” or similar. For this reason, courts could establish in the future several liabilities for the lean construction specialist and other agents of the project, depending on their actions and based on the implementation of the lean project delivery system, the target value design and the integrated project delivery. Conversely, it is possible that the level of action of the lean construction specialist may comprise design management, construction management and contract management. Accordingly, one or more building agents should be appropriately incorporated into the LOE according to their functions and responsibilities and based on the levels of action of the lean construction specialist. The creation of the following agents is proposed: design manager, construction manager and contract manager, definitions that are developed in this study. These agents are loosely defined, because any project manager, building information modeling manager or similar may act as one or as more-than-one of them. Finally, the creation of the lean construction manager is also proposed, as the agent who takes on the role of the design manager, construction manager and contract manager, but focused on the lean production principles."

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the technology, based upon the company’s submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the company’s submission for SAR was based predominantly on five randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of SAR against adalimumab, tocilizumab or placebo. The clinical effectiveness review identified no head-to-head evidence on the efficacy of SAR against all the comparators within the scope. Therefore, the company performed three network meta-analyses (NMAs) in two different populations: two in patients who had had an inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) (one for combination therapies and one for monotherapies) and the other one in patients who had had an inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis). The company’s NMAs concluded that SAR in combination with cDMARDs or as monotherapy has a statistically superior efficacy to cDMARDs and a comparable efficacy to most biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in both populations. The company submitted a Markov model that assessed the cost-effectiveness of SAR from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services in seven different populations: (1) patients with severe RA who have had an inadequate response to cDMARDs (cDMARD-IR); (2) cDMARD-IR patients with severe RA for whom methotrexate (MTX) is contraindicated or not tolerated; (3) patients with severe RA who have had an inadequate response to a TNFi (TNFi-IR); (4) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom rituximab (RTX) is not an option; (5) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated; (6) TNFi-IR patients after RTX; and (7) cDMARD-IR patients with moderate RA whose 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is between 4.0 and 5.1. The company’s economic evaluation resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) lower than £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for SAR in combination with MTX or as monotherapy versus its comparators when the comparators were less effective, and it resulted in cost savings higher than £60,000 per QALY lost when SAR was less effective, except in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible (where the ICER for SAR + MTX compared with RTX + MTX was £130,691 per QALY gained) and in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of > 4.0 (where the ICER of SAR + MTX compared with MTX was £38,254 per QALY gained). Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses after applying two changes to the company’s model: (1) use of a latent class approach to model Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) progression for patients on cDMARDs; and (2) amendment of the company’s modelling of patient progression from moderate to severe RA. The ICERs estimated by the ERG’s exploratory analyses for SAR + MTX increased to £171,466 per QALY gained when compared with RTX + MTX in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible, and to £63,438 per QALY gained when compared with MTX in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of > 4.0. The Appraisal Committee concluded that SAR in combination with MTX or as monotherapy is a cost-effective use of NHS resources in the considered populations, except in TNFi-IR patients who are RTX eligible and in patients with moderate RA and a DAS28 of > 4.0."

However, the specific effects of dopamine augmentation on risk evaluation are unclear. Here we sought to measure the effect of 100 mg oral levodopa, which enhances synaptic release of dopamine, on choice behaviour in healthy humans. We use a paradigm without feedback or learning, which solely isolates effects on risk evaluation. We present two studies (n = 20; n = 20) employing a randomised, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. We manipulated different dimensions of risk in a controlled economic paradigm. We test effects on risk-reward tradeoffs, assaying both aversion to variance (the spread of possible outcomes) and preference for relative losses and gains (asymmetry of outcomes - skewness), dissociating this from potential non-specific effects on choice randomness using behavioural modelling. There were no systematic effects of levodopa on risk attitudes, either for variance or skewness. However, there was a drift towards more risk-averse behaviour over time, indicating that this paradigm was sensitive to detect changes in risk-preferences. These findings suggest that levodopa administration does not change the evaluation of risk. One possible reason is that dopaminergic influences on decision making may be due to changing the response to reward feedback."
ZhaLiteng2017MaAo,,Modeling and Analysis of On-Demand Ride-Sourcing Markets,"Zha, Liteng",2017,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Due to the innovative business mode and advanced dispatch technology, ride-sourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft have attracted many riders, eroding the traditional taxi market. Meanwhile, substantial controversies arise along their way of expansion. Among those often highlighted are dynamic pricing, service competition and regulation. In this dissertation, we propose both analytical and simulation frameworks to address these key issues. The proposed methodologies and tools could serve as important references for regulatory agencies in evaluating and managing the ride-sourcing markets. Our first investigation is on the regulation and competition of the ride-sourcing market. An aggregate economic model is developed where the matching between customers and drivers are captured by an exogenous matching function. It is found that a monopoly ride-sourcing platform will maximize the joint profit with its drivers without any regulatory intervention. We establish the conditions for regulating only the amount of commission charged by the platform to achieve the second best. Then the model is extended into a duopoly setting and unveils that competition does not necessarily lower the price or improve the social welfare. In the latter case, regulators may rather encourage the merger of the platforms and regulate them directly as a monopolist. The exploration of dynamic pricing is divided into two main thrusts. As drivers may adjust work schedules to cover more profitable periods, we first capture drivers' work hour choices under dynamic pricing utilizing a bi-level programming framework. The patterns of the market dynamics and the trade-offs among market players are then numerically discussed. Next, we extend the model into a spatially differentiated market. The spatial variations of market frictions and the welfare of involved agents under dynamic pricing are explicitly explored. Based on an empirical dataset, we demonstrate the equilibrium outcomes under dynamic pricing and evaluate the effectiveness of a commission cap regulation. In parallel with the analytical models, an agent-based simulation is developed to better understand the ride-sourcing markets. We find that platform's matching technology exhibits increasing returns to scale property; and higher matching ranges lead to more transactions but lower magnitude of the returns to scale."

However, this is hard in practice, due to a lack of appropriate (micro-level) economic data and limited opportunity to experiment. In this work, we train social planners that discover tax policies in dynamic economies that can effectively trade-off economic equality and productivity. We propose a two-level deep reinforcement learning approach to learn dynamic tax policies, based on economic simulations in which both agents and a government learn and adapt. Our data-driven approach does not make use of economic modeling assumptions, and learns from observational data alone. We make four main contributions. First, we present an economic simulation environment that features competitive pressures and market dynamics. We validate the simulation by showing that baseline tax systems perform in a way that is consistent with economic theory, including in regard to learned agent behaviors and specializations. Second, we show that AI-driven tax policies improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by 16% over baseline policies, including the prominent Saez tax framework. Third, we showcase several emergent features: AI-driven tax policies are qualitatively different from baselines, setting a higher top tax rate and higher net subsidies for low incomes. Moreover, AI-driven tax policies perform strongly in the face of emergent tax-gaming strategies learned by AI agents. Lastly, AI-driven tax policies are also effective when used in experiments with human participants. In experiments conducted on MTurk, an AI tax policy provides an equality-productivity trade-off that is similar to that provided by the Saez framework along with higher inverse-income weighted social welfare."

ChoiByungjoo2018TRoS,,The Role of Socio-Cognitive Process in Construction Workers' Safety Behaviors,"Choi, Byungjoo",2018,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Despite continuous efforts to reduce its number of accidents, construction still remains one of the most hazardous industries in most countries. The vast majority of accidents in construction are associated with workers’ unsafe behaviors. As a result, researchers and practitioners have devoted considerable effort to investigating various approaches to reduce workers’ unsafe behaviors. Still, a noticeable lack of research and practices investigating how workers’ cognitive processes and their interactions with the environment (e.g., coworkers, managers, and site risk) affect safety behaviors persists. With this background in mind, three broad objectives have been established in this research: (1) to identify the mechanism of social influence on workers’ safety behavior, (2) to characterize how workers’ decision-making processes and the environmental factors interact to affect safety behaviors, (3) to develop research methods to overcome the limitations in previous worker behavior studies. To achieve these research objectives, five interrelated and interdisciplinary studies such as survey analyses, behavioral economic experiments, agent-based modeling and simulation of human behavior, field experiments, and physiological sensor data analysis were conducted. Through these studies it was found that: (1) safety norms shared by managers are significantly stricter than safety norms shared by workers; (2) workers’ safety behaviors are not only influenced by coworkers’ safety behaviors (i.e., workgroup norm) but also subject to managers’ safety feedback (i.e., management norms); (3) workers’ social identification with their project intensifies positive influence of management norms and attenuates negative influence on workgroup norms to improve workers’ safety behaviors; (4) project identity is the least salient in construction workers’ self-concept among diverse organizations at construction sites (e.g., workgroup, company, union, trade, project); (5) the effects of different safety management strategies (i.e., stricter safety feedback, more frequent safety feedback, and stimulation of project identification) on workers’ safety behavior vary based on site risk conditions (low, moderate, high-risk conditions); (6) electrodermal response (EDR) collected from workers’ wristband has a great potential to understand risk perception during their ongoing work. These findings identify the socio-cognitive mechanism of workers’ safety behaviors and provide insight into how to improve workers’ safety behavior and ultimately to reduce accidents in construction by promoting positive social influence regarding safety behaviors."

This paper features applied and complex models for regional economic development. In a pioneering approach that makes explicit the complex connections needed to spur growth in trade, this South Asia-focused study details a unique method to assess how Aid for Trade (AfT) investments interact with agents of economic change, such as consumers and producers and traders of intermediate and final goods and to evaluate their potential to reduce the cost of bringing more products to more markets. Furthermore, it presents a new tool for policy makers to foster regional economic integration and pursue the overarching development objective of more inclusive growth across a region. The paper shows how modeling restructuring across geographies can visualize policy choice hitherto unseen and unrecognized. The models exhibit structural changes in the regional South Asia economy through the decreases in intra-regional trade transaction costs which are influenced by a set of investment based policy choices. The cost reduction pattern and the nature of non-linear and distributed interactions between the geographic elements of the agent-based system allow it to functionally restructure itself over time. When low growth sections of the regional economy are integrated into evolving regional and global trade networks and agent-based relationships, the benefits of high economic growth are extended to low growth sections of a regional economy, as is made visually apparent in Geographic Information System (GIS) map-based simulations. The paper will review representations of regional development models in terms of their assumptions (peeled away like an onion) and in terms of their level of complexity, very much in the tradition of Peter Allen’s classification system. Traditional mechanical models of regional economic development assume away structural change with the assumption of completeness of network connections among agents in the system, thereby imposing a simplifying homogeneity on economic agents that significantly reduces explanatory power."

The size of TM is such that non-linear (NL) optimal solutions cannot be obtained even when the best available personal computers and solvers are used. Therefore, an alternative is proposed based on decomposition methods converting TM to a small-size NL macroeconomic model, called TIAM-MACRO Stand-Alone (TMSA), and where the energy model TIAM is substituted by appropriate quadratic cost-supply functions (QSF). The TIAM model and the TMSA are calibrated to the demands estimated with a scenario generator and are then solved iteratively. This report concentrates on the description and foundation of the algorithm and explains why an adjusted production function is needed to allow for sectoral income and price elasticities that reproduce/calibrate the baseline scenario. It is shown that the decomposed problem for a single region is calibrated and solved to exactly the same results as the original problem in 3 min of computer time instead of 2–3 h without decomposition. Also, for the first time, we are able to solve the global TM model with 15 regions in 1.5 h applying the approach based on TMSA (in Windows 7, 64-bit workstation, solution in a single thread)."

First, on a ""minimally rich domain"", we characterize the so-called probabilistic generalized median rules (Ehlers et al., J Econ Theory 105:408-434, 2002) by means of stochastic-dominance (sd) strategy-proofness and ontoness. Next, we study how much we can enlarge a domain to allow for the existence of sd-strategy-proof probabilistic rules that satisfy ontoness and the no-vetoer condition. We establish that the domain of ""convex"" preferences is the unique maximal domain including a minimally rich domain for these properties."

Objective We developed cardiovascular and mortality risk equations using patient-level data from the CANVAS (CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study) Program to address this shortcoming. Methods Data from 10,142 patients with T2DM at high risk for or with established CVD, randomized to canagliflozin + standard of care (SoC) or SoC alone and followed for a mean duration of 3.6 years in the CANVAS Program were used to derive parametric risk equations for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), and death. Accumulated knowledge from the widely used UKPDS-OM2 (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 2) was leveraged, and any departures in parameterization were limited to those necessary to provide adequate goodness of fit. Candidate explanatory covariates were selected using only the placebo arm to minimize confounding effects. Internal validation was performed separately by study treatment arm. Results UKPDS-OM2 predicted CANVAS Program outcomes poorly. Recalibrating UKPDS-OM2 intercepts improved calibration in some cases. Refitting the coefficients but otherwise preserving the UKPDS-OM2 structure improved the fit substantially, which was sufficient for stroke and death. For MI, reselecting UKPDS-OM2 covariates and functional form proved sufficient. For HHF, selection from a broad set of candidate covariates and inclusion of a canagliflozin indicator was required. Conclusion These risk equations address some of the limitations of widely used risk equations, such as the UKPDS-OM2, for modeling cardioprotective treatments for individuals with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk, including derivation from overly healthy patients treated with agents that lack cardioprotection and have been described as reflecting a different therapeutic era. Future work is needed to examine external validity."

When market liquidity is high, market participants are able to smoothly buy and sell their intended amount at a price close to the market mid-price. When discussing market liquidity in empirical studies, researchers have defined liquidity indicators that are consistent with their research objectives. However, it has not been clarified which market factors affect these indicators. In the present paper, we investigated which market factors affect major liquidity indicators, including Volume, Tightness, Resiliency, and Depth, using an artificial market, which is a type of agent-based simulation system. As a result, market liquidity based on Volume is completely opposite to market liquidity based on Tightness, Resiliency, or Depth. Moreover, we confirmed the price decline rate from the fundamental price and the price convergence periods to the fundamental price as a measure of the convergence speed, which is the original meaning of Resiliency, from the price level, which has been brought about by random price changes. Therefore, the trades of fundamentalists have the effect of shortening the convergence period, i.e., causing market liquidity to increase."
BalakrishnanAnantaram1991IIiM,,Information Issues in Model Specification,"Balakrishnan, Anantaram and Whinston, Andrew B",1991,Information systems research,2,4,263-286,,,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"This paper explores the tradeoffs and information issues in model specification, i.e., choosing the appropriate level of detail and precision of decision support models. For many real-time and distributed decision problems, decision-makers face a wide spectrum of information gathering choices that vary in the amount and quality of information as well as their associated costs and delays. Modeling these problems raises several operational and strategic questions including:  how much and what type of information to acquire before making a decision.  what protocol to use for exchanging information among multiple decision-makers.  what organization and information structure (e.g., centralized, coordinated, distributed) to use for effective information sharing and decision-making. We highlight the modeling issues and tradeoffs using examples from production planning, distributed processing, and network routing, and draw upon research in diverse fields, including information economics and game theory, knowledge logic in computer science, and distributed computation, to obtain model specification insights. Our discussions emphasize and illustrate two main model specification themes. First, acquiring additional information often has diminishing returns (in terms of the quality of decisions suggested by the model); therefore, an imprecise model based on partial information might be more appropriate than using a detailed and accurate model that identifies optimal decisions. Concepts from information economics and team theory provide a framework for analyzing this tradeoff. We also briefly discuss some heuristic methods to identify effective information gathering strategies. Our second theme applies to systems consisting of several decision-makers who make interdependent decisions. In this context, the decision model for each agent must be based on an understanding of what information to exchange, how frequently, and what protocol to use for exchanging information. We illustrate how complete information sharing among distributed decision-makers might even be impossible because of a possible dead-lock in decision-making. This game-theoretic phenomenon has implications for designing the organization structure, information systems, and communication protocols to support multi-agent decision-making."

A dataset on MLB's free agents between 2013 and 2017 was collected. A decision support tool was built using artificial neural networks.FindingsThere are clear links between a player's statistical performance and the decision of the player to sign a new offered contract. “Age,” “Wins above Replacement” and “the team on which a player last played” are the most significant factors in determining if a player signs a new contract.Originality/valueThis paper applied analytical modeling to personnel decision-making using the design science paradigm and guided by CAM as the kernel theory. The study employed machine learning techniques, producing a model that predicts the probability of free agents signing a new contract. Also, a web-based tool was developed to help decision-makers in baseball front offices so they can determine which available free agents to offer contracts."

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the company’s submission to NICE. Clinical evidence for cabazitaxel was derived from a multinational randomised open-label phase III trial (TROPIC) of cabazitaxel plus prednisone or prednisolone compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone or prednisolone, which was assumed to represent best supportive care. The NICE final scope identified a further three comparators: abiraterone in combination with prednisone or prednisolone; enzalutamide; and radium-223 dichloride for the subgroup of people with bone metastasis only (no visceral metastasis). The company did not consider radium-223 dichloride to be a relevant comparator. Neither abiraterone nor enzalutamide has been directly compared in a trial with cabazitaxel. Instead, clinical evidence was synthesised within a network meta-analysis (NMA). Results from TROPIC showed that cabazitaxel was associated with a statistically significant improvement in both overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mitoxantrone. Results from a random-effects NMA, as conducted by the company and updated by the ERG, indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the three active treatments for both overall survival and progression-free survival. Utility data were not collected as part of the TROPIC trial, and were instead taken from the company’s UK early access programme. Evidence on resource use came from the TROPIC trial, supplemented by both expert clinical opinion and a UK clinical audit. List prices were used for mitoxantrone, abiraterone and enzalutamide as directed by NICE, although commercial in-confidence patient-access schemes (PASs) are in place for abiraterone and enzalutamide. The confidential PAS was used for cabazitaxel. Sequential use of the advanced hormonal therapies (abiraterone and enzalutamide) does not usually occur in clinical practice in the UK. Hence, cabazitaxel could be used within two pathways of care: either when an advanced hormonal therapy was used pre-docetaxel, or when one was used post-docetaxel. The company believed that the former pathway was more likely to represent standard National Health Service (NHS) practice, and so their main comparison was between cabazitaxel and mitoxantrone, with effectiveness data from the TROPIC trial. Results of the company’s updated cost-effectiveness analysis estimated a probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £45,982 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, which the committee considered to be the most plausible value for this comparison. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be both cheaper and more effective than abiraterone. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be cheaper but less effective than enzalutamide, resulting in an ICER of £212,038 per QALY gained for enzalutamide compared with cabazitaxel. The ERG noted that radium-223 is a valid comparator (for the indicated sub-group), and that it may be used in either of the two care pathways. Hence, its exclusion leads to uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness results. In addition, the company assumed that there would be no drug wastage when cabazitaxel was used, with cost-effectiveness results being sensitive to this assumption: modelling drug wastage increased the ICER comparing cabazitaxel with mitoxantrone to over £55,000 per QALY gained. The ERG updated the company’s NMA and used a random effects model to perform a fully incremental analysis between cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide and best supportive care using PASs for abiraterone and enzalutamide. Results showed that both cabazitaxel and abiraterone were extendedly dominated by the combination of best supportive care and enzalutamide. Preliminary guidance from the committee, which included wastage of cabazitaxel, did not recommend its use. In response, the company provided both a further discount to the confidential PAS for cabazitaxel and confirmation from NHS England that it is appropriate to supply and purchase cabazitaxel in pre-prepared intravenous-infusion bags, which would remove the cost of drug wastage. As a result, the committee recommended use of cabazitaxel as a treatment option in people with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 whose disease had progressed during or after treatment with at least 225 mg/m 2 of docetaxel, as long as it was provided at the discount agreed in the PAS and purchased in either pre-prepared intravenous-infusion bags or in vials at a reduced price to reflect the average per-patient drug wastage."
JoffreOlivierM2015BOfS,,Balancing Options for Shrimp Farming : a Landscape Approach to Investigate the Future of Shrimp Farming in the Mekong Delta,"Joffre, Olivier M",2015,,,,,,,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses,,"Coastal zones support the livelihoods of millions around the world. Deltas especially have undergone rapid transformations in the last decades, with increasing population and an intensification of the uses of natural resources. In South East Asia, a significant driver of change in coastal zones is the spread of shrimp aquaculture. While providing options for economic development, shrimp farming is usually associated with environmental degradation, drives the conversion of mangrove forest into ponds and represents a highly risky and poorly resilient production system for local livelihoods. Risk of disease is an important characteristic of shrimp production systems. Shrimp diseases are numerous and the risk of disease outbreak in ponds cannot be fully controlled by farmers. Disease outbreaks result in economic losses for farmers, sometimes leading to bankruptcy. Outbreaks have the potential of decimating the production of large regions, jeopardizing an entire sector and the local economy. Various types of shrimp production systems, ranging from intensive to integrated mangrove-shrimp, are found within the coastal zone. Each of these systems has its own specificity regarding economic cost and return, and risk toward disease outbreak and related economic losses. Intensive systems based on technical knowledge, high level of inputs and requiring high investments can provide high and quick returns, but are risky. Extensive systems are less productive, accessible to smallholders and considered risky production systems for farmers. The expansion of both intensive and extensive systems along the coast was possible at the expense of mangrove ecosystems. One type of extensive systems, the integrated mangrove-shrimp system, where 40 % to 60% of the farm area is covered with mangrove, is considered less risky and more resilient than other production systems. Integrated mangrove-shrimp systems can contribute to the restoration of the mangrove cover and its associated ecological functions within the coastal zone. The combination of the different production systems shape the coastal landscape and influence the future of the shrimp aquaculture sector. The farmers’ choice to follow one production system or the other is crucial in planning shrimp aquaculture. It depends on various drivers such as bio-physical characteristics, economic aspects or drivers related to the local or international regulatory framework. Understanding how these drivers influence the decisions of shrimp farmers is a key to planning for the future of the shrimp aquaculture sector. The overall objective of this thesis is to develop an approach that integrates the decisionmaking of individual shrimp farmers in a decision support tool to better plan shrimp aquaculture, using Vietnam’s Mekong Delta as a case. This objective was translated into 4 research questions: i) What is the extent of the diversity of shrimp farming in the Mekong Delta and how productive are the production systems? ii) Is diversification through brackish water polyculture an effective risk-management strategy for smallholders? iii) What are the drivers for the adoption of diversified and integrated aquaculture practices that restore mangrove cover? iv) Can we integrate farmers’ knowledge and decision-making processes into a spatially explicit decision support approach for policy makers to test future aquaculture policies? The study was based on extensive fieldwork in different shrimp farming communities throughout the Mekong Delta and consultations with national and international expert panels to finally produce and test a new approach to investigate future scenarios of shrimp farming that combine modeling and participatory tools with stakeholders. Chapter 2 contributes to our knowledge of the diversity of shrimp production systems in the Mekong Delta’s Bac Lieu Province. Four main production systems are identified: i) intensive commercial; ii) intensive family farms; iii) brackish water polyculture farms and iv) rice-shrimp farms. Intensive farms (both commercial and family-based) are both more productive and more labor-productive than extensive rice-shrimp and brackish polyculture farms. Commercial farms are able to respond to disease risks by investing in technological inputs, meanwhile intensive family farms are most at risk of, and most affected by, disease outbreaks. They are not able to invest in appropriate technology to reduce virus occurrence. Households with limited investment capacity diversify their aquaculture production with other high value aquatic animals or adapt their production system to the local seasonal environment, by developing alternate rice-shrimp systems. The strategy adopted by some farmers to diversify pond production does not minimize the virus risk, but provides different sources of income to the households. Chapter 3 analyzes farmers’ strategies related to diversification to cope with the risk of shrimp farming. The case study in Soc Trang Province show that strategies are linked to the wealth of the aquaculture farmers who employ them. Intensification of the production, with investment in technology, reduces the virus risk; however such strategy is not affordable to medium-income farmers and found only in better-off households. The medium-income farmers do not diversify their production to reduce the risk of virus, but to significantly diversify their income portfolio and cope with income losses due to virus outbreaks within their shrimp production system. Aquaculture production other than shrimp contributes up to 50% of the aquaculture income. This diversification responds to the local market demand for crabs and fish and is enabled by the development of a supply chain of fish and crab juveniles. The juveniles and fingerlings are collected from mud flats and mangrove forest by the poorest households. This diversification strategy is dependent on the mangrove cover and the role of its habitat for crabs and fish. The widespread adoption of this strategy questions the sector’s long-term sustainability, in particular as the mangroves are being destroyed Integrated mangrove-shrimp systems are known to be less risky and more resilient to shocks than other shrimp production systems. However those integrated systems are not widespread and are limited to less than 5,000 ha in the Mekong Delta. In Chapter 4, drivers (both external and internal to the farm) that pressure or coerce farmers to shift from an extensive to an integrated mangrove-shrimp system or to maintain such system are identified from the literature. Two panels of international and Vietnamese experts were consulted to validate this list of drivers and to weight their importance in the farmers’ decision whether to shift to an integrated mangrove-shrimp system. Consultations with experts highlighted the importance of the mangrove’s ecological function to improve the pond’s water quality and reduce the risk of disease outbreak related to the farmers’ decision to shift toward integrated systems. On the other hand, the current regulatory framework and value chain’s functionality constrain the shift to integrated mangrove-shrimp by limiting its financial profit. The regulatory framework determines a benefit from timber production that is not favorable to farmers while the resulting economic benefit from forest production is low. An organic value chain is present in the Mekong Delta and accessible to integrated mangrove-shrimp farmers that comply with certification standards. However, the current value chain’s functioning characterized by delays in payments and limited premium prices do not incentivize farmers to shift to integrated mangrove-shrimp systems. To facilitate the expansion of such a production system, we recommend i) to modify arrangements within the value chain and promote transparent and equitable transactions, ii) identify and amend conflicting regulations for forest exploitation and iii) enable landscape-scale governance of mangrove and shrimp culture. Chapter 5 proposes a new approach to investigate the tradeoff of shrimp aquaculture scenarios by combining Role Playing Games (RPGs), Agent Based Modeling and Scenario building. This approach is tested in Dam Doi District in the Mekong Delta where a series of consultations and RPGs with farmers supported the development and calibration of an Agent Based Model (ABM). The model was later used with local policy makers to investigate the trade-offs of three different future scenarios for aquaculture by 2030. The results showed that intensification of the production is not sustainable and has a high social cost. Without adequate adaptation measures, climate change will significantly affect aquaculture production with higher disease risk and increased production costs. Tested policies for supporting the spread of integrated mangrove-shrimp systems are not strong enough to influence farmers’ decision toward the deployment of integrated systems. The approach used was found to be an interesting strategy to bring local farmers’ knowledge to the attention of local decision makers. In addition, farmers described the use of RPG as interesting educational material for them to learn farm and risk management. In the last chapter (Chapter 6), the main findings of the thesis are discussed in the broader context of shrimp aquaculture development. The shrimp aquaculture sector is analyzed as a complex adaptive system to identify and discuss the implications for future shrimp aquaculture planning. The applicability of the Agent Based Model to other contexts and shrimp producing countries is discussed. This research contributed to the overall knowledge of the shrimp sector in the Mekong Delta, a region among the ones with the highest produced volume in the world. This research provides an overview of technical and socio-economic processes within the sector, focusing on smallholder producers and highlights linkages between aquaculture development and natural resour"

More specifically, three alternative causation models (normal, reversed, reciprocal) were tested. Design/methodology/approach – The longitudinal study was conducted among 265 Finnish municipal employees (87.5 per cent women, mean age 48.4 years). The participants completed a questionnaire three times: at baseline (T1), about 14 months after baseline (T2) and about eight months after the second questionnaire (T3). Findings – The cross-lagged analyses based on structural equation modelling lent support to the reversed causation model more than the normal causation and reciprocal models. More specifically, team climate at T2 predicted authentic leadership across eight months at T3. Thus the study suggests that positive team climate (i.e. vision, participation safety, task orientation, and support for innovation) may foster authentic leadership in the long term and not vice versa. Practical/implications – The findings suggest that − besides improving team climate and authentic leadership themselves – team climate should be improved in order to enable authentic leadership to develop and flourish. It is important to emphasize that in forming the team climate employees are active agents and not passive targets. Originality/value – The study is among the first to test different causal models regarding authentic leadership and team climate. From the theoretical viewpoint, the findings suggest that follower-centric theories of leadership merit greater attention in the future."
HuangQilin2024APPS,,A Progressive Planning Scheme for Dynamic Expansion of Electric Vehicle Charging Resources,"Huang, Qilin and Zhou, Guanyu and Wang, Han and Dong, Qianyu and Jia, Youwei",2024,IEEE transactions on smart grid,,,1-Jan,,,IEEE,,"The mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) continuously requires the expansion of charging resources in the urban area. Such a continuing and dynamic problem associated with multi-level of uncertainties can hardly be tackled by deterministic models. To overcome this challenge, this paper newly proposes a progressive planning scheme (PPS) for dynamic expansion of charging resources deployment. Specifically, a simulation environment is constructed by considering EV user behavior model and evaluation model. Based on this, a tailored deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is proposed to direct the concerned expansion problem, of which the objective is to enhance social welfare while adhering to specific economic and technical constraints. The proposed model leverages an attention mechanism and an inflation coefficient to enable the agent to selectively focus on dominant features and effectively adapt to variable planning schemes. Moreover, the DRL model is incorporated with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to obtain the exploration-exploitation trade-off, through which more valid and generalizable decisions can be generated. Comparative case studies are carried out to verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods, which demonstrate averaging 4.79% and 11.38% improvement over the advanced reinforcement learning algorithm and the genetic algorithm in an approximating real-world environment, respectively."

We provide complementary insights by developing an agent-based simulation model of an actual system. This facilitates understanding the strategy selection of heterogeneous companies through computational learning. We use a detailed model of the Spanish system, where companies trade through a uniform price, pool-based spot market. We model market power in this pool through agents offering to generate with conjectured price responses estimated from supply function equilibrium assumptions. We envisage the introduction of a forward market, with price formation following the conventional financial perspective of expected spot plus a risk premium. We find, in general, that larger companies prefer to exercise market power in the spot market, while smaller companies prefer to contract forward, but strategy selection itself can be quite a delicate, situation specific process."
ButelLynne2006CoeT,,Clusters of entrepreneurs The application of ant colony optimisation modelling,"Butel, Lynne and Watkins, Alison",2006,Journal of modelling in management,1,3,255-269,,,Emerald Group Publishing,BINGLEY,"Purpose - Entrepreneurs operate in conditions of dynamic uncertainty; identifying and exploiting opportunities presented by the business environment. Opportunistic search is core to entrepreneurial activity, but its dynamics are rarely explored. Groups of entrepreneurs are attracted to the same potential business opportunities. They have no incentive to cooperate, they may not even know of the existence of others. However, over time, clusters of entrepreneurs interested in the same opportunities develop. Aims to discuss the issues. Design/methodology/approach - Ant colony optimisation modelling is used to simulate the activities of entrepreneurs in an opportunity rich environment. The entrepreneurs must identify the locations of the appropriate resources. Three simulations were run to observe entrepreneurial success in different environments. Findings - A random search of the business environment for resources by individual entrepreneurs was unproductive. Once the entrepreneurs learned to read the business environment and so refine their search, they were increasingly efficient. This was even more pronounced when time allowed for search was constrained and weaker entrepreneurs had little influence. Research limitations/implications - The computer simulations demonstrate how a cluster of entrepreneurial activity may begin. The results raise questions about the appropriateness of policies supporting entrepreneurial activity and about the path dependency of cluster development. Empirical research is now needed to test these research implications. Originality/value - Focusing on the little explored dynamics of opportunistic search by would-be entrepreneurs in a spatially defined business environment combines previous research in the fields of entrepreneurial outcomes and cluster development. Using a multi-agent search model to simulate the dynamic interaction of a number of entrepreneurs in the same business environment demonstrates early cluster formation without the protagonists relying on cooperative, competitive or value chain interaction."
KhaninDmitry2012Slar,,"Short-termism, long-termism, and regulatory focus in venture capitalists' investment decisions","Khanin, Dmitry and Turel, Ofir",2012,Venture capital (London),14,1,61-76,,,Routledge,ABINGDON,"Short-termism and long-termism are characterized in the literature as suboptimal intertemporal trade-offs defined, respectively, as prioritizing the short term over the long term (to the detriment of the long term) and prioritizing the long term over the short term (to the detriment of the short term). Advancing this perspective, we argue that short-termism and long-termism could be approached as opportunistic strategies utilized by agents to earn private benefits at the principal's expense. Venture Capitalists (VCs) may use either of these strategies to take advantage of limited partners and entrepreneurs. How can principals detect opportunistic tendencies on the part of VCs as agents? We argue that the principals can do so by examining the effect of the two suboptimal intertemporal trade-offs on VCs' investment proclivities. Thus, we contend that short-termism amplifies VCs' eagerness to invest whereas long-termism magnifies VC's eagerness to provide follow-on investment. Counterintuitively, short-termism may also augment long-termism but only under promotion and not prevention framing. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 50 US-based VCs provided support for all the proposed hypotheses."
