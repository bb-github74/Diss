# \textcolor{blue}{Introduction} (1 page)

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a novel computational methodology for representing the behavior of individuals in order to study social phenomena. Its use is rapidly growing in many fields. We review ABM in economics and finance and highlight how it can be used to relax conventional assumptions in standard economic models. In economics, ABM has enriched our understanding of markets, industrial organization, labor, macro, development, environmental and resource economics, as well as policy. We present a vision for how ABMs might be used in the future to build more realistic models of the economy and review some of hurdles that must be overcome to achieve this.

More in-debt discussion can be found at @axtell_agent-based_2022 where authors surveys the use of such computational agents in economics and finance over the past 60 years, reviewing what has been accomplished, describing current practice and looking to future prospects, while assessing potential bottlenecks to further progress. 


We use an agent-based computational approach to show how inflation can worsen macroeconomic performance by disrupting the mechanism of exchange in a decentralized market economy. We find that, in our model economy, increasing the trend rate of inflation above 3% has a substantial deleterious effect, but lowering it below 3% has no significant macroeconomic consequences. Our finding remains qualitatively robust to changes in parameter values and to modifications to our model that partly address the Lucas critique. Finally, we contribute a novel explanation for why cross-country regressions may fail to detect a significant negative effect of trend inflation on output even when such an effect exists in reality [@stiglitz_heterogeneous_2011]


@methenitis_degrees_2020 The imperfect decision-making of human buyers participating in retail markets varies from fundamental models that assume rational economic choices: even in markets with identical items human buyers are not rational, i.e., buyers do not	always choose the cheapest option. Recent developments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce enable market participation by software agents that are (almost) perfectly rational due to their computational capacity. However, the increasing degree	of buyers’ rationality might have unfavorable effects on retail markets with regards to the competition between sellers and the resulting prices. In this paper, we study the effects of varying degrees of buyers’ rationality on the competition and the	prices buyers face in retail markets with identical items. We use the multinomial logit function to model different degrees of buyers’ rationality. We further model the competition between sellers using k-level reasoning: each seller computes the price to offer (best response strategy) with regards to its belief for the competition. First, we derive an analytical best response strategy (price) of a seller given the competing prices and the degree of buyers’ rationality, and show that there exists an optimal degree of buyers’ rationality that minimizes the price. Last, we use evolutionary game theory to show that perfect rationality leads to unstable competition dynamics increasing the overall cost for buyers. In contrast, bounded rationality leads to smoother dynamics and lower cost for buyers. Our insights raise the need to revisit design objectives for software agents in retail markets in light of their wider systematic impact.

@guilmi_dual_2022 We present a hybrid macro-agent-based model estimated on Japanese data. We study the effects of secondary employment on inflation and output. Demand uncertainty impacts on inflation and Phillips curve. Minimum-wage indexation and workers	bargaining power determine inflation. Quantitative easing can lower inflation by increasing secondary employment. The paper presents a stock-flow-consistent hybrid macro-agent-based model estimated on Japanese data to study the interdependency among	the dual labor market, output, and wage dynamics. By modeling the use of secondary workers as a financial buffer for non-financial firms, the paper investigates the possible impact of uncertainty and financial fragility on inflation and the weakening	of the trade off between inflation and unemployment. The paper also contributes to the recent developments in the estimation of agent-based models by presenting an original technique, which relies on the identification and optimization of surrogate models. The numerical results show that the elasticity of firms’ hiring choices to volatility in demand is the main behavioral factor affecting both inflation and the Phillips curve, revealing that uncertainty can have consequences also on prices and not only on real variables as already discussed by the literature. Inflation and Phillips curve are also influenced by the bargaining power of workers and by the indexation of minimum wages, while conventional monetary policy and fiscal policy have limited effects. Unconventional monetary policy can have unintended deflationary consequences, by allowing financially distressed firms, which are more likely to resort to secondary workers, to survive.

@chen_job_2020 As suggested by recent empirical evidence, one of the causes behind the widespread rise of inequality experienced by OECD countries in the last few decades may have been the increased flexibility of labor markets. The authors explore this	hypothesis through the analysis of a stock-flow consistent agent-based macroeconomic model able to reproduce with good statistical precision several empirical regularities. They employ three different sensitivity analysis techniques, which indicate	that increasing job contract duration (i.e. decreasing flexibility) has the effect of reducing income and wealth inequality. However, the authors also find that this effect is diminished by tight monetary policy and low credit supply. The last result	suggests that the final outcome of structural reforms aimed at changing labor flexibility can depend on the macroeconomic environment in which these are implemented.


**similar models**  
@gulden_agent-based_2013 This paper makes use of an agent-based framework to extend traditional models of comparative advantage in international trade, illustrating several cases that make theoretical room for industrial policy and the regulation of trade. Using an agent based implementation of the Hecksher-Ohlin trade model; the paper confirms Samuelson's 2004 result demonstrating that the principle of comparative advantage does not ensure that technological progress in one country benefits its trading partners. It goes on to demonstrate that the presence of increasing returns leads to a situation with multiple equilibria, where free market trading policies can not be relied on to deliver an outcome which is efficient or equitable, with first movers in development enjoying permanent advantage over later developing nations. Finally, the paper examines the impact of relaxation of the Ricardian assumption of capital immobility on the principle of comparative advantage. It finds that the dynamics of factor trade are radically different from the dynamics of trade in goods and that factor mobility converts a regime of comparative advantage into a regime of absolute advantage, thus obviating the reassuring equity results that stem from comparative advantage.

@colucci_can_2011 This work provides a computational cobweb model with heterogeneous adaptive producers with endogenous market entry and exit. Firms face a borrowing constraint and so can go bankrupt. At the same time when average profits are positive
there is an inflow of new firms in the market. Bounded dynamics and endogenous volatility are shown to follow without resorting to nonlinearities.


**shift to international trade or multi-country model**  
@dosi_public_2021 In this article, we study the effects of industrial policies on international convergence using a multicountry agent-based model which builds upon *Dosi et al. (2019b, J. Econ. Dyn. Control, 101, 101–129)*. The model features a group of microfounded economies, with evolving industries, populated by heterogeneous firms that compete in international markets. In each country, technological change is driven by firms’ activities of search and innovation, while aggregate demand formation
and distribution follow Keynesian dynamics. Interactions among countries take place via trade flows and international technological imitation. We employ the model to assess the different strategies that laggard countries can adopt to catch up with
leaders: market-friendly policies; industrial policies targeting the development of firms’ capabilities and R$\&$ D investments, as well as trade restrictions for infant industry protection; protectionist policies focusing on tariffs only. We find that markets cannot do the magic: in absence of government interventions, laggards will continue to fall behind. On the contrary, industrial policies can successfully drive international convergence among leaders and laggards, while protectionism alone is	not sufficient to support catching up and countries get stuck in a sort of middle-income trap. Finally, in a global trade war, where developed economies impose retaliatory tariffs, both laggards and leaders are worse off and world productivity growth
slows down.


**limitations**  
@fagiolo_critical_2007 This paper addresses the methodological problems of empirical validation in agent-based (AB) models in economics and how these are currently being tackled. We first identify a set of issues that are common to all modelers engaged in	empirical validation. We then propose a novel taxonomy, which captures the relevant dimensions along which AB economics models differ. We argue that these dimensions affect the way in which empirical validation is carried out by AB modelers and we
critically discuss the main alternative approaches to empirical validation being developed in AB economics. We conclude by focusing on a set of (as yet) unresolved issues for empirical validation that require future research.

## 1. Parent: Exit, Entry and Firm Dynamics in long run equilibrium

-	Analysis a dynamic stochastic model for a competitive industry which endogenously determines process for entry and exit and for individual firms output and employment.  
-	Stationary^[]  equilibrium  
-	Conditions to entry and exit:  
-	Analysis: Firm size and Age cohorts  
-	Effects on the parameters describing technological and market changes.  

## 2. 2. Model  

-	Uncertainty: productivity shocks   
-	Entry: requires non-recoverable and sunk cost  
-	Entry and Exit are equal.  
-	The steady distributions for size, profits, and value   

#### 2. 2. 1. Aim   

-	Characteristics of the process for firm shocks, the cost of entry, and production technology determine the stationary equilibrium distributions and the entry and exit rate.   

#### 2.2.2. Exit Conditions   

-	a positive fixed cost is necessary for exit to take place and is equivalent to the existence of a fixed outside opportunity cost for resources (e.g. managerial ability) used by the firm.  
-	A.3 and A.2 In equilibrium firm exit the industry whenever their state falls below a reservation level $x$  
-	A.4 implies that the life span of a firm is almost surely finite, preventing the mass of firms from escaping to a no exit region  
-	 

#### 2.2.3. Entry conditions   

-	Each period before the new shocks are realized, potential entrants may enter  
-	A firm that exists secures a present value which normalized to zero  
-	A firm must pay an entry cost greater than or equal to zero. After paying this cost its productivity shocks, which is drawn from an initial distribution v is revealed.  

### Uncertainty   

-	Firm specific productivity shock   
-	There are no industry-wide shocks, this implies that aggregate output, employment, prices, and the frequency distribution for phi follow deterministic paths   
-	The new entrants draw their initial shocks is also the distribution of realized values across new entrants. The distribution of these initial shocks represents the range and frequency of different possible initial conditions that the new entrants face.   

## Melitz Model   

### Model Implications   

#### Theoretical Contribution  

-	The model incorporates firm heterogeneity into the analysis of international trade, demonstrating that only the more productive firms engage in exporting while less productive firms serve the domestic market or exit.  
-	The model shows how trade liberalization leads to intra-industry reallocations of resources from less to more productive firms, enhancing overall industry productivity.  

#### Empirical Implications   

-	The model provides a framework for understanding empirical patterns observed in international trade, such as why only a subset of firms exports and how trade impacts firm-level productivity.
-	It has inspired numerous empirical studies examining the relationship between trade and productivity, firm survival, and market reallocation

#### Policy Insights  

-	The paper highlights the importance of considering firm-level responses to trade policy changes, suggesting that trade liberalization can lead to productivity gains by encouraging resource reallocation towards more efficient firms.  
-	It provides a basis for policymakers to understand the potential gains from trade and the distributional effects within industries.  

#### Extensions and Influence  

-	Melitz's model has been extended in various directions, including incorporating factors such as firm dynamics, multi-product firms, and the role of financial constraints.  
-	The paper has influenced a broad range of subsequent research in international trade, industrial organization, and macroeconomics.    


#### Citations and Recognition  

-	The 2003 paper is one of the most cited  in the field of international trade, reflecting its wide acceptance and influence in academic research.  
-	It has been a foundation for further theoretical developments and empirical testing, making it a seminal work in modern trade theory.  

### What is the Model?  

# \textcolor{blue}{Data Relevant} (2-3 pages)  

# \textcolor{blue}{ABM of Melitz model} (2-3 pages)  

When constructing an agent-based model that includes various types of economic entities such as financial institutions, manufacturing firms, and service industries, it's important to carefully consider the differences between these entities and how they interact within the model. While you can treat them all as institutions, you might want to differentiate their behaviors and characteristics based on their roles and functions. Here's how you might approach this:

Entity Differentiation: Instead of treating all entities as identical, consider defining distinct attributes and behaviors for each type of entity. Financial institutions might have different decision-making processes, risk profiles, and capital allocation strategies compared to manufacturing firms or service industries.

Agent Attributes: Assign attributes to each type of entity that capture their unique characteristics. For financial institutions, these attributes might include capital reserves, investment strategies, and risk tolerance. For manufacturing firms, attributes could include production capacity, technology adoption, and supply chain dynamics.

Decision Rules: Define decision rules that reflect the specific activities and objectives of each type of entity. Financial institutions might make decisions related to investments, lending, and risk management. Manufacturing firms could decide on production levels, technology upgrades, and supplier relationships. Service industries might focus on customer acquisition, quality of service, and pricing strategies.

Interaction Rules: Model interactions between different types of entities. Financial institutions might provide loans or investments to manufacturing firms, influencing their growth and expansion. Manufacturing firms could supply products to service industries, which in turn influence customer demand.

Market Dynamics: Consider how different types of entities interact in markets. Manufacturing firms might buy raw materials from suppliers, while financial institutions might offer credit to support these transactions. Service industries could provide services to both manufacturing firms and financial institutions.

Data and Parameters: Gather relevant data and parameters that reflect the behavior of each type of entity. This could include historical financial data for financial institutions, production and cost data for manufacturing firms, and customer data for service industries.

Sensitivity Analysis: Perform sensitivity analyses to explore how changes in parameters or interactions affect the overall system. This can help you understand the robustness of your model and identify key drivers of outcomes.

By differentiating these entities and considering their unique attributes and behaviors, you can create a more realistic and nuanced agent-based model that captures the complexities of interactions within a diverse economic system. This approach allows you to explore how different types of entities contribute to overall market dynamics, economic growth, and the impact of various policies or shocks.
